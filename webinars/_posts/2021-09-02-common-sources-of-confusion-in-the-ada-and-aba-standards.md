title: Common Sources of Confusion in the ADA and ABA Standards
date: 2021-09-02
excerpt: Certain provisions in the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards are prone
  to misinterpretation and generate many of the technical assistance inquiries
  the Access Board receives. This webinar will review and clarify common sources
  of confusion in the standards, including application of the standards in new
  construction and alterations, work and dining surfaces, toilet rooms, signs,
  accessible routes and ground surfaces, and other areas and elements. Session
  participants are encouraged to share their own areas of confusion and submit
  questions in advance of the session. This webinar will include video remote
  interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Questions can be submitted in
  advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar. Webinar
  attendees can earn continuing education credits.
