About this Guide {#about}
----------------

Standards issued under the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) apply to
facilities designed, built, altered, or leased with federal funds. Four
agencies establish the ABA Standards according to guidelines issued by
the Access Board:

-   Department of Defense (DOD)
-   Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
-   General Services Administration (GSA)
-   U.S. Postal Service (USPS).

This guide explains requirements in the current editions of the [ABA
Standards](../aba-standards.html) issued by DOD, GSA, and USPS, which
are substantively the same as each is closely based on the Board's
updated ABA guidelines (2004). (HUD has yet to update its ABA Standards
and continues to apply the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards to
facilities under its jurisdiction.)

It is important to use this guide along with a complete copy of the ABA
Standards as it explains, but does not contain or reprint, the text of
the ABA Standards. In addition to explaining the requirements of the ABA
Standards, this guide also provides clearly labeled recommendations for
best practices that exceed the minimum requirements and are thus
optional to follow.

This guide is in the public domain, and users are free to distribute and
share its content or to disseminate copies. Questions or comments on the
guide should be directed to the Access Board at [This email address is

### The Architectural Barriers Act (ABA)

The Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) requires access to facilities that
are designed, built, or altered with federal funds or leased by federal
agencies. Passed in 1968, it is one of the first laws to address access
to the built environment. The law applies to federal buildings,
including post offices, social security offices, federal courthouses and
prisons, and national parks. It also covers non-federal facilities, such
as public housing units and mass transit systems, built or altered with
federal grants or loans. Coverage is limited to those funding programs
that give the federal agency awarding grants or loans the authority to
establish facility standards. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
of 1990 has similar design mandates but applies to facilities in the
private sector and the state/local government sector without regard to
federal funding.

Four agencies establish the ABA Standards according to guidelines issued
by the Access Board: the General Services Administration (GSA), the
Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). The latest
editions of the [ABA Standards](../aba-standards.html) issued by GSA,
DOD, and USPS are substantively the same and replace the
earlier [Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards](../ufas.html). HUD's
update of the standards is still pending. Regulations and directives
from these agencies apply the standards to facilities within their
purview.

![envelope](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter1-aba/1aba-usps.jpg){width="60"
height="35"} **Postal Facilities**\
USPS regulations (39 CFR Part 255) and RE-4 Handbook apply the current
standards to USPS projects and leases as of October 1, 2005.

![pentagon](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter1-aba/1aba-dod.jpg){width="70"
height="41"} **Defense Facilities**\
A DOD policy memorandum applies the current standards to defense
facilities as of October 31, 2008, and exempts facilities or spaces
"used exclusively by able-bodied military personnel."

![house](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter1-aba/1aba-hud.jpg){width="65"
height="59"} **Residential Facilities**\
HUD regulations (24 CFR Part 40) apply the standards (currently UFAS) to
all residential structures covered by the ABA except those on military
installations.

![federal
building](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter1-aba/1aba-gsa.jpg){width="65"
height="63"} **All Other Facilities Covered by the ABA**\
GSA's Federal Management Regulation (41 CFR Part 102-76) applies its ABA
Standards to construction and alterations that begin after May 8, 2006,
lease-construction as of June 30, 2006, and other lease actions
solicited after February 6, 2007.

### Military Exclusions {#military-exclusions style="clear: both;"}

The ABA exempts military facilities and spaces designed and constructed
for use exclusively by "able-bodied military personnel," including
Reserve and National Guard facilities. Facilities used by DOD in
emergencies and natural disasters are also exempt. DOD nonetheless
recommends that exempted military facilities meet the standards "to the
maximum extent that is reasonable and practicable" because facility uses
often change over time.

### Enforcement of the ABA

Under the ABA, the standard-setting agencies (GSA, DOD, HUD, and USPS)
are responsible for making sure that facilities under their authority
meet the standards. The Access Board also plays an enforcement role by
examining complaints or allegations of non-compliance. Upon receipt of a
complaint, the Board opens an investigation to determine whether the
facility is covered by the ABA and, if so, whether it meets the
applicable standards. If a covered facility is not in compliance with
the standards, the Board will pursue a corrective action plan from the
responsible entity and monitor the case until violations are remedied.
Investigations are conducted in cooperation with the appropriate federal
agencies, and cases are typically resolved amicably.

The Access Board also provides free technical assistance and training on
the ABA Standards to the public, federal agencies, architects,
advocates, and others.

|                                                                       |
| Another law that requires compliance with access standards is the     |
| Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 504 of this law requires access   |
| to programs and services that are funded or conducted by the federal  |
| government. By attaching compliance requirements to program monies,   |
| its scope is generally broader than the ABA's. Compliance with access |
| standards is required under Section 504 where covered programs        |
| involve facility construction and alteration. Section 504 also may    |
| require retrofits to existing facilities as necessary to provide      |
| access to programs and services. Federal agencies are responsible for |
| issuing regulations to ensure compliance by funding recipients and    |
| have designated Section 504 officials. It is expected that most       |
| federal agencies will update their 504 regulations to apply design    |
| requirements consistent with those of the ABA and ADA to facilitate   |
| compliance.                                                           |

###  Current Edition of the ABA Standards

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![ADA-ABA Accessibility Guidelines (cover)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter1-ada/1ada-aba.jpg){width="115" height="151"}
  *The current ABA Standards are based on  the Board's updated ABA guidelines (2004).*
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The design requirements of the ABA are first developed by the Access
Board as guidelines. The Board's guidelines set a minimum baseline for
the enforceable standards issued by GSA, DOD, HUD, and USPS. The
current [ABA Standards](../aba-standards.html) (except those issued by
HUD) are based on updated guidelines the Board issued in 2004 without
any substantive changes.

**Differences Between the ABA and ADA Standards**

The Board also maintains guidelines for non-federal facilities covered
by the ADA. These guidelines serve as the basis for ADA Standards issued
by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and, in the case of facilities used
to provide designated public transportation, the Department of
Transportation (DOT). The Board jointly updated its ADA and ABA
guidelines to make them more consistent. As a result, the current ABA
Standards and ADA Standards are very similar, but there are several
substantive differences between them.

The ABA Standards differ from the ADA Standards in these areas:

• *Modifications and Waivers (§F103)*\
Requests for a modification or waiver of the ABA Standards must be based
on need and processed through the appropriate standard-setting agency,
while the ADA Standards permit "equivalent facilitation" alternatives
providing equal or greater access.

• *Work Areas*\
The ABA Standards generally require full access to work areas, while
requirements for work areas in the ADA Standards are more limited
(§203.9 and §206.2.8).

• *Additions (§F202.2)*\
The ABA Standards provide more stringent requirements for additions.

• *Leased Facilities (§F202.6)*\
The ABA Standards include requirements for newly leased facilities not
contained in the ADA Standards.

• *Exceptions for Vertical Access/ Elevators (§F206.2.3)*\
Provisions unique to private sector facilities in the ADA Standards,
including an exception from the requirement for vertical access or
elevators, are not included in the ABA Standards (a more limited
exception for public sector facilities is included in both the ABA and
ADA Standards).

• *Emergency Transportable Housing (§F233, §809)*\
The ABA Standards include requirements for emergency transportable
housing provided by the government in disasters and emergencies.
Corresponding and additional revisions made to §F106.5, § F202.6,
§F203.9, §F205.1, §F206, §F208, §F215.5, §F228.2, §405, §409.1, §604.5,
§606, §607.4, §608 and §804.3.

• *Outdoor Developed Areas (§F244 - §F248, §1011 -- §1019)*\
The ABA Standards address access to outdoor areas developed by the
federal government, including trails, picnic and camping areas, and
beach access routes. The ADA Standards do not yet include similar
requirements for non-federal sites.

The ADA Standards as implemented by DOT and DOJ include unique
provisions not contained in the ABA Standards:

•* DOT's ADA Standards for Transportation Facilities*\
DOT's ADA Standards modify provisions for accessible route location
(§206.3), bus stops/stations (§810.2.2), and rail station platform
(§810.5.3), and require detectable warnings on curb ramps (§406.8).

• *DOJ's ADA Standards and Regulations*\
Unique provisions in the DOJ's ADA Standards address scoping for
assembly areas (221), medical care facilities (223), transient lodging,
including housing at places of education (224), detention and
correctional facilities (232), and residential dwelling units and social
service establishments (233).

**Model Building Codes and Industry Standards![IBC (2003) and ANSI
A117.1 Standard
(covers)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter1-ada/1ibc.jpg){width="175"
height="205"}**

The current ABA Standards have been harmonized to a significant extent
with industry standards and model building codes, including the
International Building Code (IBC). The IBC contains application and
scoping provisions for accessibility (in chapters 10, 11 and 34) that
correspond to those in the ABA Standards (chapters F1 and F2). For
technical provisions, the IBC references a consensus standard developed
through the American National Standards Institute (the ANSI A117.1
standard) which is highly consistent with the technical chapters (3 --
10) of the ABA Standards. There are some substantive differences. For
example, unlike the ABA Standards, the ANSI standards require an
additional vertical grab bar at water closets, transfer shower stalls,
and tubs.

The ABA Standards also reference several industry standards, including
the ASME elevator safety code and the NFPA 72 Fire Alarm Code. In
addition, the ABA Standards reference provisions in the IBC covering
accessible means of egress.

###  Chapter 1: Application and Administration {#chapter-1-application-and-administration}

### Purpose \[[§F101](../aba-standards/chapter-1-application-and-administration.html#F101%20Purpose)\]

The ABA Standards apply to newly constructed or leased facilities and to
alterations and additions. Since the Board jointly published the ABA
guidelines with its ADA guidelines, the letter "F" (for "federal")
precedes section numbers in the application and scoping chapters of the
ABA guidelines. While the scoping and technical requirements for new
construction also apply to alterations and additions, provisions and
exceptions specific to existing facilities and elements are provided
throughout the document. Requirements for additions and leased
facilities are scoped separately but reference the same technical
criteria. 

**Existing Facilities**

In existing facilities, the ABA Standards apply directly to altered
areas and additions. While the ABA does not have retrofit mandates,
other laws do. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which requires
access to federally funded or conducted programs, may necessitate
retrofits where no alterations are planned. While this "program access"
requirement can sometimes be satisfied operationally, such as by
relocating a program, in many cases retrofits to existing facilities are
necessary. The Rehabilitation Act also requires accommodations for
employees with disabilities in the federal sector under Section 501.

Existing facilities previously built, altered, or leased according to
earlier editions of the ABA Standards, such as the Uniform Federal
Accessibility Standards (UFAS), generally do not have to be modified to
meet the current standards except where altered. Existing facilities
that are newly leased must be brought into compliance with relevant
requirements in the current standards (but existing elements that comply
with earlier ABA Standards do not have to meet the current standards
unless altered).

**Furnishings and Equipment![office
chair](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter1-ada/1chair.jpg){width="150"
height="172"}**

The ABA Standards, like most building requirements and codes, apply to
those elements that are fixed or built-in. Moveable elements and
furnishings are generally not addressed or covered by the standards.
Other regulations, such as those issued under the Rehabilitation Act,
may impact non-fixed elements, such as changing office furniture to
accommodate an employee.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![design compass](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/compass.jpg){width="35" height="63"}*Recommendation: *Design spaces so that planned furnishings and moveable elements are accommodated without encroaching into accessible routes and clearances. It is also helpful to consider relevant requirements in the standards when specifying or acquiring moveable furnishings, such as tables, systems furniture, and vending machines to ensure their usability.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unless specifically permitted, access features required by the standards
must be fixed or built-in even though portable alternatives may be
available. This includes requirements for assistive listening systems,
visual alarms, ramps, and platform lifts.

**Maintenance of Accessible Features**

It is important that accessible features be properly maintained in
working order. Features of facilities and equipment required to be
accessible should be maintained in operable working condition, except
for isolated or temporary interruptions in service due to maintenance or
repairs. However, it is important that accessible features be properly
maintained in working order.

### ![girl using wheelchair](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter1-ada/1girl.jpg){width="175" height="250"} Dimensions for Adults and Children \[[§F102](../aba-standards/chapter-1-application-and-administration.html#F102%20Dimensions%20for%20Adults%20and%20Children)\]

The ABA Standards provide technical specifications for building elements
designed specifically for use by children 12 and younger. These
provisions address access for children to:

-   drinking fountains (§602)
-   water closets and toilet compartments (§604)
-   lavatories and sinks (§606) and
-   dining and work surfaces (§902).

The standards also include requirements for play areas (§1008) and
recommendations (advisory notes) on children's reach ranges (§301.1) and
ramp handrails (505.4).

The standards do not specify where or when elements are to be designed
for children. This determination is left to other building requirements
or regulations, good practice, client preference, or other factors. The
provisions for children's use (other than those for play areas) are
structured as exceptions to specifications based on adult dimensions,
and following an exception is always optional. However, where the
decision is made to design certain elements based on children's
dimensions and to use the exceptions, the alternate specifications
provided in the standards must be followed. The standards do not require
provision of additional accessible elements in order to separately
accommodate both children and adults, although doing so may be advisable
in mixed use spaces. For example, in some restrooms at facilities such
as schools and children's museums, it is a good idea to provide a
wheelchair accessible toilet compartment for adults and another for
children.

###  Modifications and Waivers \[[§F103](../aba-standards/chapter-1-application-and-administration.html#F103%20Modifications%20and%20Waivers)\]

The standard-setting agencies (GSA, DOD, HUD, and USPS) are authorized
to grant modifications and waivers of the ABA Standards on a
case-by-case basis where clearly necessary. Modifications and waivers
are rare and are usually considered only in unique circumstances that
make compliance with certain provisions exceptionally problematic. The
Access Board is responsible for making sure that modifications and
waivers are based on findings of fact and are consistent with the ABA.

Requests for modifications or waivers are reviewed by designated
officials or departments:

-   Administrator of General Services upon request forwarded by agency
    or GSA department heads (for facilities other than military, postal,
    and residential facilities)
-   Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and
    Readiness as forwarded through the DOD chain of command (defense
    facilities)
-   USPS Facilities Headquarters, Design and Construction Programs
    (postal facilities)
-   Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (residential facilities)

###  Conventions \[[§F104](../aba-standards/chapter-1-application-and-administration.html#F104%20Conventions)\]

Most dimensions in the standards are specified as a minimum, maximum, or
range. In a few areas, an absolute dimension is specified. 

**Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances**

A tolerance is an unintended, but permitted (i.e., "tolerated"),
variation from a specified dimension resulting from the process of
construction or manufacture. The ABA Standards recognize conventional
industry tolerances for dimensions not expressed as a range. This
applies to field work, not design work. Tolerances necessary for a
particular manufacturing process are also permitted. Information on
specific tolerances may be available from industry and trade
organizations, code groups and building officials, and published
references.

Many dimensions in the ABA Standards are expressed as a range instead of
an absolute so that designers can allow some room for minor deviations
in construction or manufacturing. Tolerances do not apply to dimensions
specified as a range.

**Grab Bar Diameter and Clearance**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![Grab bar diameter 1 1/4\" - 2\" (tolerance not allowed) and knuckle clearance 1 1/2\" absolute (tolerance allowed)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter1-ada/1gbar.jpg){width="350" height="278"}
  *Construction or manufacturing tolerances are permitted for the required clearance at grab bars since this is an absolute dimension (1½ inch), but they are not permitted for the grab bar diameter because a range is specified (1¼" to 2").*
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Calculation of Percentages**

Some provisions in the standards specify a minimum number of elements or
spaces as a minimum percentage or proportion. Rounding up to the next
greater whole number is required where fractions or remainders occur.
For example, if the standards require access to at least 5% of an
element and a total of 25 are provided, at least 2 must be accessible
(rounding up from 1.25).

In the case of specifications for dimensions or sizes that involve
percentages or ratios, rounding down for values less than ½ is allowed.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![design compass](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/compass.jpg){width="35" height="63"}*Recommendation:  *Dimensions expressed as a range are intended to accommodate deviations in the field. It is good practice to specify accordingly. For example, for the location of wheelchair accessible water closets (16" -- 18" centerline from side walls or partitions), specifying to the midpoint of the range (17") will accommodate any construction variations up to 1" plus or minus. For dimensions not expressed as an absolute ("X maximum" or "Y minimum"), specify in a manner that accommodates the expected tolerance within the required dimensions by subtracting the tolerance from the required maximum or adding it to the required minimum.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Figures in the Standards**

Figures are provided in the standards for informational purposes (unless
stated otherwise) to illustrate dimensions and requirements contained in
the text. For compliance purposes, the text governs.

###  Referenced Standards \[[§F105](../aba-standards/chapter-1-application-and-administration.html#F105%20Referenced%20Standards)\]

The standards reference industry standards for certain elements,
including automated doors (ANSI/BHMA standards), means of egress
(International Building Code), fire alarms (NFPA National Fire Alarm
Code), elevators and platform lifts (ASME Safety Code), and play
surfaces (ASTM standards).

The specific editions of these documents referenced by the ABA Standards
must be followed. The Access Board intends to update references to these
standards and codes to recognize later editions, as appropriate.

### Definitions \[[§F106](../aba-standards/chapter-1-application-and-administration.html#F106%20Definitions)\]

Terms used in the standards are defined in this section. Some terms are
defined not in the standards, but in regulations and directives from
standard-setting agencies, such as those pertaining to alterations to
"primary function areas" and requirements for accessible paths of
travel. Defined terms in referenced standards govern when not defined in
either the ABA Standards or regulations. Definitions provided by
collegiate dictionaries are relevant for terms not defined by either the
ABA Standards, regulations, or referenced standards.

### Common Questions

*What types of Federal funding are covered by the ABA Standards?*

The ABA Standards apply to facilities that are federally funded. This
includes facilities that are designed, built, altered, or leased by, or
on behalf of, the Federal government. The ABA Standards also apply to
other types of facilities that receive federal funding, but ABA coverage
is limited to federal grants or loans that are used for facility design,
construction, or alteration where the federal agency that awards the
grant or loan has the authority to establish facility standards.

*Does an existing facility that complies with UFAS (or an earlier ABA
standard) have to be brought into compliance with the latest edition of
the standards under the ABA?*

No, if the facility meets the standards that were in effect at the time
of its construction, alteration, or leasing. However, any new
alterations or additions must comply with the current ABA Standards.
Also, existing facilities that are newly leased by the federal
government are subject to provisions in the current standards for leased
facilities. Existing elements that comply with earlier ABA Standards are
not required to meet the current ABA Standards unless altered, as noted
in the standards (§F203.2).

*Are federal facilities required to meet the ADA Standards as well as
the ABA Standards?*

Federal government facilities are subject only to the ABA Standards
(which are very similar to the ADA Standards). However, non-federal
facilities that receive federal funding may be subject to the ABA
Standards in addition to the ADA Standards. For example, a county
courthouse or jail built with federal monies would be covered by the ADA
Standards (as a local government building) and by the ABA Standards (as
a consequence of federal funding). Also, in a privately owned office
building covered by the ADA Standards, space leased by a federal agency
would be subject to the ABA Standards as well. 

*Can later editions of the industry standards or building codes
referenced by the ABA Standards be used?*

The specific editions of these standards referenced by the ABA Standards
are to be followed (although the Access Board intends to update
references to keep them current).

New Construction
----------------

![construction
crane](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-ada/nc1.jpg){width="100"
height="99"}

This guide provides an introduction to the scoping requirements of
the [ABA Standards](../aba-standards.html) and is intended to be used
with a complete copy of the ABA Standards since it does not contain or
address the full content of the Standards. It is important that users
familiarize themselves with the specific scoping requirements contained
in the ABA Standards.

### **![Diagram -- circle labeled "Chapter 2" pointing circles representing Chapters 3 - 10](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-aba/nc2.jpg){width="200" height="198"}Scoping Requirements**

Requirements in Chapter F2 indicate which elements and spaces must be
accessible on a site or in a facility (the scope of coverage). These
"scoping" requirements apply technical provisions in Chapters 3 -- 10 to
those covered elements and spaces provided on a site.

Applicable building codes, design practices, and other factors determine
the elements and spaces required for a site, including parking, means of
egress, and plumbing fixtures. The ABA Standards, on the other hand,
specify the elements and spaces provided that must be accessible.

### Application \[[§F201](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F201%20Application)\]

The ABA Standards apply to the various types of federally funded
facilities subject to the ABA, from simple structures to complex,
multi-facility sites. Requirements in the standards apply to both
exterior and interior spaces and elements provided on a site, usually
without distinction. Provisions for parking, for example, apply equally
to exterior lots and to parking garages. The standards cover permanent
facilities and temporary facilities (other than those used in
construction), such as reviewing stands, stages, portable toilets, and
temporary classrooms.

In new construction, all areas must be fully accessible, including
multiple spaces of the same type, unless otherwise specified. Areas not
required to be fully accessible include:

-   certain limited-use or raised spaces that are exempt (§F203)
-   spaces covered by scoping provisions that require only a specified
    portion of the total number to comply, such as dressing rooms and
    patient bedrooms (various provisions in Chapter 2)

### General Exceptions \[[§F203](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F203%20General%20Exceptions)\]

These structures and spaces are fully exempt from the standards and are
not required to be accessible or on an accessible route:

![Cover of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards
(UFAS)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-aba/nc3.jpg){width="60"
height="72"} 
:::

**Existing Elements (§F203.2)**\
In existing facilities, alterations, additions, or leasing actions may
require retrofit of existing elements. Existing elements that meet an
earlier ABA standard, such as the [Uniform Federal Accessibility
Standards](../ufas.html), do not have to be retrofitted to meet the
current standards unless they are altered. \
*Examples: Existing restrooms, drinking fountains, and telephones in
additions or that are part of an accessible path of travel to altered
primary function areas do not have to be upgraded to meet the current
standards if they comply with a previous ABA standard*

###  Specific Spaces and Occupancies

The ABA Standards include scoping requirements specific to certain types
of spaces and facilities that apply based on the intended use and
design. Spaces with multiple uses must meet all applicable requirements
for each use. Scoping provisions for specific spaces and occupancies

### ![question mark](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/ques.jpg){width="100" height="100"}

### Common Questions

*Are all public use and common use areas required to be accessible?*

All areas of facilities are required to be fully accessible in new
construction except those that are specifically exempt (e.g., certain
types of limited use or raised spaces) or that are covered by provisions
that require only a specified portion to comply (e.g., transient lodging
guest rooms and patient bedrooms). All other rooms and spaces, including
multiple ones of the same type, such as patient exam rooms, classrooms,
and courtrooms, are required to be accessible.

*Are employee work areas required to be accessible?*

Yes, the ABA Standards apply fully to employee work areas (unlike the
ADA standards which have more limited requirements for such spaces).
Elements used by employees in work areas, including work surfaces, must
comply. Spaces used by employees for purposes other than work, including
restrooms, break rooms, locker rooms, lounges, and parking are also
fully covered.

*Can access be provided after construction based on need?*

Access required by the ABA Standards must be put in place and ready for
use as part of construction. This is required in all but a few specified
instances, such as:

-   Toilet and bathrooms in residential dwelling units or accessed
    through an individual's private office for his or her exclusive use
    are not required to be built with certain specifically enumerated
    access features, such as grab bars and lavatory clearances, if they
    are built according to criteria that will facilitate later
    installation or adaptation, such as reinforcement for grab bars and
    removable vanity cabinets.
-   Vertical access to work stations in courtrooms, such as judges'
    benches, can be provided after construction if space and other
    requirements are met to ease later installation of necessary ramps
    or lifts.

height="98"}](single-file-version.html#intro)

This guide provides an introduction to the scoping requirements of
the [ABA Standards](../aba-standards.html) and is intended to be used
with a complete copy of the ABA Standards since it does not contain or
address the full content of the Standards. It is important that users
familiarize themselves with the specific scoping requirements contained
in the ABA Standards.

### General \[[§F202.1](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F202%20Existing%20Buildings%20and%20Facilities)\]

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *![cover of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-aba/nc3.jpg){width="80" height="96"}Additions, alterations, and leasing actions may require retrofit of existing elements. Existing elements that meet earlier editions of the ABA standards, such as the *[Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards](../ufas.html)*, do not have to be modified to meet the current standards unless altered (§F203.2).*
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and alterations undertaken at existing facilities are covered
by the ABA Standards. The extent of application is largely determined by
a project's scope of work as the standards apply to those elements or
spaces that are altered or added. Additional requirements apply to
projects that affect or could affect the usability of, or access to, an
area containing a primary function. The standards also require certain
elements and spaces to comply in existing facilities leased by Federal
agencies.

### Additions \[[§F202.2](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F202%20Existing%20Buildings%20and%20Facilities)\]

Projects that increase, expand, or extend a facility's gross floor area
or height of a facility are considered additions (as defined in §F106.5)
and must comply with requirements of the standards applicable to new
construction. However, existing elements and spaces affected by an
addition are treated as alterations and qualify for certain allowances
or exceptions that are not permitted in new construction.

### **Application of the Standards in Additions** {#application-of-the-standards-in-additions style="text-align: center;"}

![Existing facility and addition. Figure notes: Existing portions of a
facility affected by an addition are treated as alterations. Newly built
portions added to an existing facility are treated as new construction.
An accessible route must connect additions to site arrival points
directly or, if an addition does not include an entrance, through an
existing facility. If not provided in an addition, entrances, toilet and
bathing facilities, telephones, and drinking fountains provided in
existing facilities must be made accessible to serve the
addition.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-aba/a1.jpg)

### Requirements for Additions {#requirements-for-additions style="text-align: center;"}

*If not included in an addition, these elements and spaces must be made
accessible in the existing facility, where provided:*

-   *toilet and bathing facilities for each sex (an accessible unisex
    facility is allowed where only 1 toilet or bathing facility is
    provided or where compliance to multi-user facilities is technically
    infeasible)*
-   *a public telephone*
-   *a drinking fountain*

![Building with accessible route shown from public sidewalk, accessible
parking spaces, and public transportation stop to entrance of addition.
Icons for men's room, women's room, drinking fountain, and phone
indicated for existing portion of
facility.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-aba/a2.jpg) 

*At least 1 accessible route is required from site arrival points
(accessible parking, passenger loading zones, public streets and
sidewalks, and transit stops, where provided) to an accessible addition
entrance. If the addition does not have its own entrance, an entrance of
the existing facility must be made accessible to serve the addition and
an accessible route must serve all accessible spaces and elements of the
addition.*

*These requirements apply fully to all additions. Cost caps based on
"disproportionality" are not recognized for additions (but are permitted
for a path of travel to altered primary function areas).*

###  Alterations \[[§F202.3](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F202%20Existing%20Buildings%20and%20Facilities)\]

Alterations are defined in the standards (§F106.5) as "a change in a
building or facility that affects or could affect the usability of a
building or facility or portion thereof." Many types of projects are
covered as "alterations," including remodeling, renovation,
rehabilitation, reconstruction, restoration, resurfacing of circulation
paths or vehicular ways, and changes or rearrangement of structural
parts, elements, or walls. Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or
wallpapering, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not
considered alterations unless they affect a facility's usability. For
example, a project limited to an HVAC system that includes the addition
of thermostats would affect a facility's usability because it involves
elements (operable parts) covered by the standards.

The standards ensure that the opportunities for accessibility presented
by an alteration are taken. How and to what extent the standards apply
is determined by the scope of a project and the elements and spaces
altered. Only those elements or spaces altered are required to comply,
but alterations made to areas containing a primary function (a major
activity for which a facility is intended) also require an accessible
path of travel.

### Application of the Standards in Alterations {#application-of-the-standards-in-alterations style="text-align: center;"}

![Floor plan with alterations to non-primary function area and to
primary function area. Figure notes: Altered elements and spaces are
required to comply. In areas not containing a primary function, an
accessible route to an altered element or space is required only when
the circulation path to the altered element or space is also altered.
Alterations made to areas containing a primary function also require an
accessible path of travel to the extent that it is not
"disproportionate" to the cost. The accessible path of travel must
extend to site arrival points, including
parking.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-ada/a3.jpg)

 \
If alterations are limited only to elements in a room or space, then the
standards apply only to the elements altered. Similarly, where spaces
are altered, the standards apply to those spaces that are altered. If a
room or space is completely altered (or built new as part of an
alteration), the entire room or space is fully subject to the standards.
Compliance is required to the extent that it is technically feasible.

### Example: Toilet Room Alterations {#example-toilet-room-alterations style="text-align: center;"}

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![Figure of toilet room with altered elements highlighted: toilet, grab bars, faucet controls, and mirror. ](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-ada/a5a.jpg){width="450" height="311"}
  *In a restroom project involving alterations to the toilet, grab bars, faucet controls, and mirror, the standards apply to these elements but not to those that remain unaltered. In more extensive projects where additional elements are altered, application of the standards is greater, commensurate with the scope of work.*
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![design compass](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/compass.jpg){width="35" height="63"}*Recommendation:  *While only those elements altered are required to comply, it is advisable to maximize opportunities for accessibility in alterations. Alteration of multiple elements in a room or space may provide a cost-effective opportunity to make the entire room or space fully accessible.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The standards do not require alterations to exceed the level of access
required in new construction. For example, spaces that are exempt in new
construction are also exempt in alterations.

**Prohibited Reduction in Access**

New construction requirements also set the baseline for any alteration
that would effectively reduce existing accessibility. Alterations that
reduce accessibility below the level that would be required in new
construction are prohibited. Reductions in access are allowed only
where, and to the extent that, the minimum level required in new
construction is exceeded. For example, if an alteration will reduce the
number of parking spaces on a site, accessible parking spaces can be
proportionately reduced as long as the minimum required in new
construction (based on the parking facility's new total) is met.
Elements that are not required by the standards to be provided for
accessibility, such as phones, can be completely removed from a site.

height="220"}**Special Provisions for Alterations**

The standards apply the same requirements used in new construction to
alterations but also include provisions unique to alterations. Some
provisions clarify application, while others are structured as
exceptions that limit coverage or relax technical criteria under certain
conditions. Located throughout the standards at the relevant scoping or
technical requirement, these provisions and exceptions are distinguished
by references to "alterations" or "existing facilities."

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------

**Technical Infeasibility**

Compliance in an alteration is not required where it is "technically
infeasible." The term is defined as "something that has little
likelihood of being accomplished because existing structural conditions
would require removing or altering a load-bearing member that is an
essential part of the structural frame; or because other existing
physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of
elements, spaces, or features that are in full and strict compliance
with the minimum requirements."

Where technical infeasibility is encountered, compliance is still
required to the maximum extent technically feasible.

**Example of Technical Infeasibility**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![Floor plan shows toilet room constrained in size by corridor./ min. egress width, stair tower, and elevator and freight elevator shafts](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-ada/a11.jpg){width="600" height="478"}
  *It may be technically infeasible in an alteration to enlarge a toilet room confined in size by structural supports, elevator shafts, mechanical rooms and chases, stairways, or required egress routes not affected by the project. In this case, the toilet room must be sized and other requirements, including those for plumbed fixtures, must be met to the maximum extent technically feasible. However, the concept of technical infeasibility remains relative to the planned scope of work. If the entire building is significantly renovated or gutted, constraints of this type would likely not exist. *
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other examples where compliance could potentially be technically
infeasible include:

-   conflicts with applicable building, plumbing, life safety or other
    codes (such as when combining two toilet stalls to create an
    accessible stall would violate the plumbing code's required fixture
    count);
-   meeting slope requirements on existing developed sites located on
    steep terrain where necessary re-grading and other design solutions
    are not feasible; or
-   work that would impact load-bearing walls and other essential
    components of the structural frame, including structural
    reinforcement of the floor slab.

###  Alterations Affecting Primary Function Areas \[[§F202.4](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F202%20Existing%20Buildings%20and%20Facilities)\]

Additional requirements apply when alterations are made to areas
containing a "primary function," which is a major activity intended for
a facility. Examples of primary function areas include dining areas of a
restaurant, retail space in a store, exam rooms in a doctor's office,
classrooms in a school, and offices and other work areas where the
activities of a covered entity are carried out. Spaces not considered
primary function areas include entrances, corridors, restrooms, break
rooms, employee locker rooms, and mechanical or electrical closets.
Restrooms are not primary function areas unless their provision is the
primary purpose of a facility, such as a highway rest stop.

****![Symbols: Path of travel, restroom, phone, drinking
fountain](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-ada/a12.jpg)**Accessible
Path of Travel**

When alterations are made to a primary function area, an accessible path
of travel to the area must be provided. The accessible path of travel
must extend from the altered primary function area to site arrival
points, including public sidewalks and parking and passenger loading
zones provided on the site. The path of travel also includes access to
restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains, where provided to serve
the primary function area.

**Disproportionality (20%)**

The accessible path of travel is required to the extent that it is not
"disproportionate" to the total cost. Regulations and directives
implementing the standards define "disproportionate" as exceeding 20% of
the total cost of alterations to the primary function area. The 20% cap
applies only to costs associated with the accessible path of travel,
including an accessible route to the primary function area, entrances,
and retrofits to restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains.

**Prioritization**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Additional information on the requirements for alterations to primary function areas is provided in *[regulations and directives](../aba-standards.html)* implementing the ABA standards.*
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compliance is required up to the point the 20% cost cap is reached, even
where it does not result in a fully accessible path of travel. Where
costs exceed this cap, ABA standard-setting agencies recommend
compliance in this order of priority:

1.  an accessible entrance
2.  an accessible route to the primary function area
3.  restroom access
4.  an accessible telephone
5.  an accessible drinking fountain
6.  accessible parking

### Accessible Path of Travel {#accessible-path-of-travel style="text-align: center;"}

![Plan view: accessible path of travel shown extending from altered

notes: The accessible path of travel extends from the altered primary
function area to site arrival points (public sidewalks, parking,
passenger loading zones, public transit stops located on the site). The
path of travel also includes an accessible restroom (for each sex unless
only unisex restrooms are provided), telephone, and drinking fountain
serving the primary function area, where such elements are provided.

### Alterations to Qualified Historic Facilities \[[§F202.5](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F202%20Existing%20Buildings%20and%20Facilities)\]

National Register of Historic
Places\"](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-ada/a14.jpg){width="225"
height="102"}The standards contain specific provisions for qualified
historic facilities which are defined as buildings or facilities that
are "listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places or designated as historic under an appropriate State or
local law."

Like other existing facilities, the requirements for alterations apply
in relation to the planned scope of work. Alterations provisions and
exceptions, including those based on technical infeasibility, and
requirements for path of travel to primary function areas, apply equally
to historic facilities.

The standards also provide several exceptions where compliance with the
standards would threaten or destroy the historic integrity or
significance of a facility as determined by the appropriate State
Historic Preservation Official or Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation. These exceptions apply to requirements for accessible
routes (§F206.2) entrances (§F206.4), and toilet rooms (§F213.2).

![Exceptions for Qualified Historic Facilities (where compliance would
threaten or destroy a facility's historic significance) Historic

arrival point to an accessible entrance (§F206.2.1, Ex. 1). At least 1
public entrance is required to be accessible (if that would also
threaten the historic significance, access can be provided to a
non-public entrance but a notification or remote monitoring system is
required for locked entrances) (§F206.4, Ex.
2).](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-aba/a3.jpg)

### Leases \[[§F202.6](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F202%20Existing%20Buildings%20and%20Facilities)\]

Existing facilities leased in whole or in part by federal agencies must
meet a minimum level of access specified in the standards. These
requirements apply when a new lease is negotiated, even when the space
was previously occupied by a federal agency. Compliance is not required
at facilities that are either leased:

-   for 12 months maximum without renewal or extension options; or
-   on a temporary, emergency basis for government officials providing
    disaster relief services.

Certain elements, spaces, and routes are required to comply to ensure a
minimum level of usability. Other elements are required to comply only
if altered or added. Facilities that are built for leasing by federal
agencies must fully comply with standards as new construction.

### Requirements for Federally Leased Space {#requirements-for-federally-leased-space style="text-align: center;"}

![Office building with accessible parking spaces and accessible route to

accessible route is required from site arrival points (accessible
parking, passenger loading zones, public streets and sidewalks, and
transit stops, where provided) to an accessible entrance.

### ![question mark](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/ques.jpg){width="100" height="100"}

### Common Questions

*What requirements of the standards apply in an alteration?*

Application of the standards in an alteration is determined by the scope
of work and whether it involves areas containing a primary function.
Altered elements or spaces must comply with relevant provisions of the
standards except where compliance is technically infeasible. Where
compliance is technically infeasible, compliance is required to the
maximum extent feasible. If alterations are made to an area containing a
primary function (a major activity for which a facility is intended), an
accessible path of travel from the area to site arrival points, as well
as the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the area,
must be made accessible as part of the work to the extent it is not
"disproportionate" (more than 20% of the total cost).

*How is "technically infeasible" determined in an alteration?*

Determining "technical infeasibility" requires a site-specific
assessment of constraints or complications in relation to the planned
scope of work. The term, as defined in the standards (§106), is intended
to encompass design, site, engineering or other constraints that
prohibit compliance. Examples include work that would impact a
facility's structural frame or that would conflict with applicable codes
or building requirements.

*Do the standards apply to existing facilities that are not being
altered?*

The ABA Standards only address existing facilities where alterations or
additions occur or where facilities are leased by federal agencies.
However, the Rehabilitation Act (section 504) requires access to
federally funded or conducted programs and may necessitate retrofits to
existing facilities where no other alterations are planned. The
obligation to provide "program access" can sometimes be satisfied
operationally, such as by relocating a program, but retrofits to remove
existing access barriers are often necessary.

![floor](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3gf1.jpg){width="100"
height="101"}

This guide explains requirements in the [ABA
Standards](../aba-standards.html) for floor and ground
surfaces. Specifications for floor and ground surfaces address surface
characteristics, carpeting, openings, and changes in level.  They apply
to:

-   interior and exterior accessible routes, including walking surfaces,
    ramps, elevators, and lifts
-   stairways that are part of a means of egress
-   required clearances, including clear floor space, wheelchair seating
    spaces, turning space, and door maneuvering clearances
-   accessible parking spaces, access aisles, and accessible passenger
    loading zones.

### Firmness, Stability, and Slip Resistance \[[§302.1](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#302%20Floor%20or%20Ground%20Surfaces)\]

Accessible floor and ground surfaces must be stable, firm, and slip
resistant.  Stable surfaces resist movement, while firm surfaces resist
deformation by applied forces.  Accessible surfaces remain unchanged by
external forces, objects, or materials.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![paved sidewalk](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3gf2.jpg){width="400" height="230"}
  *Hardened materials such as concrete, asphalt, tile, and wood are sufficiently firm and stable for accessibility.*
   
  ![gravel walkway](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3gf3.jpg){width="400" height="229"}
  *Most loose materials, including gravel will not meet these requirements unless properly treated to provide sufficient surface integrity and resilience.  Binders, consolidants, compaction, and grid forms may enable some of these materials to perform satisfactorily but require repeated maintenance.*
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Slip Resistance**

![slippery floor warning
symbol](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3gf4.jpg){width="100"
height="125"}Accessible surfaces must be slip resistant to minimize
hazards to people with disabilities, especially those who are ambulatory
or semi-ambulatory or who use canes, crutches, and other walking aids. 
However, the standards do not specify a minimum level of slip resistance
(coefficient of friction) because a consensus method for rating slip
resistance remains elusive.  While different measurement devices and
protocols have been developed over the years for use in the laboratory
or the field, a widely accepted method has not emerged.  Since rating
systems are unique to the test method, specific levels of slip
resistance can only be meaningfully specified according to a particular
measurement protocol.  Some flooring products are labeled with a slip
resistance rating based on a laboratory test procedure.

Compliance with the standards requires specifying surface materials,
textures, or finishes that prevent or minimize slipperiness under the
conditions likely to be found on the surface.  Standard practices for
minimizing floor or ground slipperiness will likely satisfy compliance
with the standards as slip resistance is important not just for
accessibility but for general safety as well.  Applications and finishes
used to increase a surface material's slip resistance may require
continued maintenance or re-application. 

**Surface Smoothness**

The standards limit changes in level and openings in floor and ground
surfaces, but they do not further address overall surface smoothness. 
Rough surfaces composed of cobblestones, Belgian blocks, and similar
materials can be difficult and sometimes painful to negotiate with
wheeled mobility aids due to the vibrations they cause. 

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![cobblestone surface](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3gf5.jpg){width="400" height="302"}
  *Cobblestones and other rough surfaces make wheelchair travel difficult and uncomfortable.*

  ![design compass](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/compass.jpg){width="35" height="63"}*Recommendation: * **Avoid materials or construction methods that create bumpy and uneven surfaces in areas and along routes required to be accessible.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Carpet \[[§302.2](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#302%20Floor%20or%20Ground%20Surfaces)\]

Carpet that is thick, cushiony, or loose impairs accessibility,
particularly wheelchair maneuvering.  The standards specify the maximum
pile height (1/2" measured to the backing, cushion, or pad) and texture
(level or textured loop, level cut pile, or level cut/uncut pile) and
require firm backing.  Cushions or pads also must be firm or can be
avoided to ensure greater firmness. 

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![wheelchair rolling across carpet that is buckling](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3gf6.jpg){width="400" height="302"}
  *Carpeting must be securely attached so that it does not shift or buckle against wheeled traffic. Cushions or pads, if used, also must be properly secured to resist movement.  Rolling or buckling occurs when carpet is not properly secured and makes wheelchair maneuvering very difficult*
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
Exposed edges must have trim on the entire length of the exposed edge
and be fastened to the floor to prevent curling.  Trim must meet
specifications for changes in level, including requirements for beveled
edges when the height exceeds ¼ inch.  The maximum height is ½ inch. 

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###  Openings \[[§302.3](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#302%20Floor%20or%20Ground%20Surfaces)\]

Openings in ground and floor surfaces, such as grates, are limited in
width to prevent passage of a ½" diameter sphere.  Wheelchair casters
can get wedged into wider openings. 

**Surface Opening (Cross Section)**

  *![grate openings oriented so that long dimension is perpendicular to travel direction](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3gf10.jpg){width="400" height="302"}*   *Elongated openings, like those of most grates, must be oriented so that the long dimension is perpendicular to the dominant travel direction.  In locations where there is no dominant flow pattern, openings must be limited to ½" in both dimensions.  Where an accessible route is available to bypass openings completely, they can be oriented in any direction.* 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Changes in Level \[[§303](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#303%20Changes%20in%20Level)\]

Changes in level can be up to ¼\" without treatment or ½\" if beveled
with a slope no steeper than 1:2.  Changes in level above a ½\" must be
treated as a ramp or curb ramp (or a walkway if a slope no steeper than
1:20 can be achieved).  These specifications apply to all portions of
accessible routes, including thresholds and carpet trim.

### ![question mark](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/ques.jpg){width="100" height="100"}Common Questions

*Must accessible surfaces be paved?*

Concrete, asphalt, and other paved surfaces are more reliably compliant,
but other materials, such as wood, and construction methods can be used
to provide firm and stable surfaces.  Loose material like gravel will
not perform adequately unless it is sufficiently stabilized by binders,
compaction, or other treatments and will likely require repeated
maintenance.  

*What is the minimum level of slip resistance required by the
standards?*

The standards require ground and floor surfaces to be slip resistant,
but they do not specify a minimum level of slip resistance or
coefficient of friction.  This value varies according to the measurement
method and protocols used.  Some products are labeled with a rated
level, but in the absence of a consensus test procedure, the standards
do not set a minimum value.  Standard methods to prevent or minimize
slipperiness in the specification of floor materials, textures,
applications, and finishes may be sufficient for compliance with the
standards. 

*Is there a minimum distance between changes in level?*

The standards do not require a minimum horizontal separation between
changes in level of a ½" or less. Such level changes may need to be in
close proximity, such as at raised thresholds (otherwise a minimum 48"
separation will provide enough wheelchair space so that only one
vertical change is negotiated at a time). Ramps and curb ramps, which
must be used to span vertical changes greater than ½", must have level
landings and clearances at the tops and bottoms of each run to provide
adequate separation and resting intervals between sloping surfaces. 

*Elongated surface openings must be perpendicular to the dominant
direction of travel, but what if there is no dominant direction of
travel?*

When there is no dominant direction of cross traffic, openings must be
limited to ½" in both dimensions. Where space allows accessible routes
to completely bypass the area with openings, elongated openings can be
oriented in either direction.

[]{#space}Clear Floor or Ground Space and Turning Space
-------------------------------------------------------

![International Symbol of Accessibility and clear floor space
designation](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3cfs1.jpg){width="100"
height="101"}

This guide explains requirements in the [ABA
Standards](../aba-standards.html) for clear floor or ground space and
turning space. Clearances are required at accessible elements, fixtures,
and controls so that people with disabilities, including those who use
wheelchairs, can approach and use them. The standards also address
maneuvering space for wheelchair turning. Provisions throughout the
standards reference these basic "building block" requirements.

### Clear Floor or Ground Space \[[§305](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#305%20Clear%20Floor%20or%20Ground%20Space)\]

Sufficient clear floor or ground space is required at accessible
controls, operable parts, drinking fountains, lavatories and sinks, ATMs
and fare machines, appliances, beds, and other elements. Provisions for
these elements apply the clear floor or ground specifications in 305.

   *![Clear floor space highlighted at fire extinguisher cabinet, drinking fountain, and electrical outlet](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3cfs2.jpg){width="600" height="370"}*
        *Clear floor space is required at each accessible element, including storage cabinets, drinking fountains and other fixtures, and electrical outlets. Clear floor spaces can overlap where elements are in close proximity.*
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Position
\[[§305.5](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#305%20Clear%20Floor%20or%20Ground%20Space)\]**

At most elements, clear floor or ground space can be positioned for
either a forward or a side approach. For better usability, a forward
approach is required at certain elements, including dining and work
surfaces, drinking fountains, lavatories, and most sinks. At other
elements, a side approach is allowed. A side approach is typically
provided or required at sales and service counters, beds, and most
appliances.

Objects that provide space for toes or knees can overlap a portion of
the clear floor space. Knee and toe space allows a closer approach to
elements and reduces the reach to operable parts. It is required at some
elements, such as drinking fountains and lavatories, so that people
using wheelchairs can pull up to them.

### Turning Space \[[§304](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#304%20Turning%20Space)\]

![icons representing toilet/bathing facilities, dressing rooms,
transient lodging, dwelling units, medical care facilities, and prison
cells](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3cfs17.jpg){width="150"
height="238"}Turning space is required in these accessible rooms and
spaces:

-   toilet and bathing facilities
-   dressing, fitting, and locker rooms
-   transient lodging guest rooms
-   dwelling units (all rooms on an accessible route)
-   patient bedrooms
-   holding and housing cells
-   saunas and steam rooms
-   raised courtroom stations served by ramps or lifts with entry ramps
-   certain recreation spaces (amusement ride load/ unload areas,
    fishing piers and platforms, play components, and shooting
    facilities)

Space for turning is also required along accessible routes where a 180
degree turn around an obstruction less than 48" wide is required
(§403.5.2).

**Clear Width at 180 Degree Turn Around a Narrow Obstruction**

![Turning space at obstructions less than 48\" long require a clearance
of 60\" min. (or 48\" min. if both connecting routes are 42\" min.

**![Person in plan view turning wheelchair by moving wheels in opposite
directions](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3cfs18.jpg){width="300"
height="328"}Maneuvering for Turns**

Maneuvering for 180 degree turns varies by person and the mobility aid
used. An efficient way of turning using a manual wheelchair is to turn
the wheels in opposite directions for a pivoting turn. Some power chairs
also may permit tight circular turns.

A three-point turn is common when using scooters and other motorized
devices that have a larger turning radius. 

![Person using scooter shown in plan view making 3-point

**Size
\[[§304.3](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#304%20Turning%20Space)\]**

Turning space can be provided in the shape of a circle or a T. Elements
with knee and toe space can overlap a portion of the turning space.

**Circular Turning Space**

![Sink with knee and toe space overlapping portion of 60\" min. diameter

  ![design compass](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/compass.jpg){width="30" height="54"}*Recommendation: * To provide easier access, locate elements with knee and toe space outside the turning space or, with circular space, limit overlap to approximately 12" so that wheelchair space 48" long minimum remains clear.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**T-Shaped Turning Space**

T-shaped space can be configured for approach on any segment (stem or
either arm).

![T-shaped turning space with overall width of 60\" min. and overall
depth of 60\" min. with each arm and stem 36\" wide min. Object with

**Door Swing
\[[§304.4](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#304%20Turning%20Space)\]
and Other Space Requirements**

Doors can swing into the turning space. The turning space can overlap
other space requirements, including clear floor space required at
elements and fixtures.

### ![question mark](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/ques.jpg){width="100" height="100"}

### Common Questions

*Is clear floor space required to be centered on elements?*

The standards require the clear floor space to be centered on wheelchair
accessible drinking fountains (forward approach), kitchen work surfaces,
(forward approach), and washers and dryers (side approach). Centering
the clear floor space on other elements is often advisable, but not
required.

*Can doors swing into required clear floor or ground space?*

Doors cannot swing into required clear floor or ground spaces in these
specific instances:

-   clear floor space at controls for automatic and power assisted doors
    and gates (404.3.5)
-   fixture clearances in toilet and bathing facilities (except those
    that are single user where wheelchair space beyond the door swing is
    provided) (603.2.3)
-   clear floor space required at benches in saunas and steam rooms
    (612.2)
-   clear floor space required at tactile signs, which must be beyond
    the arc of any door swing between the closed position and 45 degree
    open position (703.4.2)
-   dressing, fitting, or locker rooms unless wheelchair space is
    provided beyond the arc of the door swing (803.3)

In other locations, doors can swing into clear floor or ground space,
although locating door swing outside required clearances is advisable.

*Can doors swing into turning space?*

Yes, doors can swing into turning space.

*Can clear floor/ground space or turning space overlap other space
requirements?*

Yes, clear floor or ground spaces and turning space can overlap other
required clearances, including other clear floor spaces, door
maneuvering clearances, and fixture clearances.

*Is turning space required in all rooms and spaces?*

No. Turning space is required in certain spaces, such as toilet and
bathing facilities, dressing and fitting rooms, and transient lodging
guest rooms. Unless addressed by a specific requirement for turning
space in the standards, other spaces are not required to provide them,
including lobbies, offices, and meeting rooms.

height="101"}

This guide explains requirements in the [ABA
Standards](../aba-standards.html) for operable parts.

### Operable Parts Covered \[[§F205](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F205%20Operable%20Parts)\]

Compliance is required for operable parts located in accessible spaces
and along accessible routes. Operable parts include light switches,
electrical and communication receptacles, thermostats, alarm pulls,
automatic door controls, and other elements used by facility occupants.

**Examples of Operable Parts**

![Examples of operable parts (fire extinguisher cabinet, drinking
fountain, fire alarm pull, and electrical outlet. Notes: Compliance is
required for the operable portions of fixed elements, such as cabinet
hardware, but not for inoperable portions or to non-fixed components,
such as fire extinguishers; Electrical outlets, alarm pulls, and many
other types of receptacles and controls are covered; Provisions for
drinking fountains and other elements covered by the standards also
apply the criteria for operable parts; Exempt: floor receptacles and
operable parts used only by service or maintenance
personnel.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3op2-text.jpg){width="550"
height="529"} 

**Examples of Operable Parts in Kitchens**

**![Examples of operable parts in kitchens (faucet controls, outlets,
appliance controls, and cabinet handles). Labels and notes: Electrical
outlets, switches, and faucet controls are required to comply; Appliance
controls and handles to accessible storage are also covered as operable
parts; Controls on elements outside reach range, such as range hoods,
require provision of a second control; If redundant controls (other than
light switches) are provided for an element, one control in each space
is not required to comply; Exempt: HVAC diffusers and dedicated
electrical or communication
receptacles.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3op3-text.jpg){width="550"
height="563"}**

###  **Operable Parts \[[§309](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#309%20Operable%20Parts)\]**

Requirements apply generally to all types of operable parts covered.
They are also referenced by technical sections of the standards covering
drinking fountains, faucet and flush controls, ATM and fare machines,
appliances, storage, windows, and door and gate hardware, and other
elements.

**Accessible Features of Operable Parts**

![Person using wheelchair at fire extinguisher cabinet with labels
noting: operable portions meet usability criteria and are within
accessible reach ranges (non-operable portions can be located outside
reach range); clear floor space for approach and positioning; and an

accessible
route.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3op4-text.jpg){width="550"
height="460"}**Forward and Side Approaches**

At most elements, clear floor space can be positioned for either a
forward approach or a side approach. A forward approach is required at
some elements, such as drinking fountains and lavatories, for easier
access.

The range for unobstructed reaches (15" -- 48") applies only to those
portions of elements that are operable. Non-operable portions can be
located outside the range.

\
**Obstructed High Reach**

The maximum reach of 48" is reduced to 44" when the depth of reach over
an obstruction exceeds 20." Knee and toe space must extend the full
depth of reach.

\[[§309.2](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#309%20Operable%20Parts)\]**

Clear floor space can be oriented for a side approach instead of a
forward approach at most operable parts. Nominal centering of the space
on operable portions of elements is advisable, but not required (except
at washers and dryers).

\
**Clear Floor Space**

Additional clearance is required if the space is obstructed on three
sides for more than half the depth to allow easier maneuvering into the
space.

\[[§308.3](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#308%20Reach%20Ranges)\]**

\
The range for side reach, like forward reach is 15" to 48" if
unobstructed. The maximum reach depth for this range is 10" measured
from the available clear floor space.

The operable parts of fuel dispensers located on existing curbs can be
up to 54" high.

\
**Obstructed High Reach**

The maximum high reach is reduced to 46" when the reach over an
obstruction is deeper than 10" (to a maximum of 24"). Obstructions at
side reaches are limited to a height of 34".

**Advisory Reach Range for Children** 

The standards include advisory (non-mandatory) reach ranges based on
children's dimensions that can be followed when operable parts are
designed for use by children. This guidance provides reach ranges
recommended according to three age groups.

**Operation
\[[§309.4](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#309%20Operable%20Parts)\]**

Operable parts must be usable with one hand and not require:

-   tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist, or
-   more than 5 pounds of force (lbf) to operate.

Parts that can be operated without hand or finger dexterity, fine motor
movement, or simultaneous actions provide easier access and accommodate
a broader range of users.

###  Common Questions

\
*Are redundant controls for an element required to comply?*

If redundant controls, other than light switches, serve a single
element, one control in each space is not required to comply. If a
redundant control is located in a different space, however, it must
comply. All light switches are required to comply.

*What types of electrical or communication receptacles are exempt
because they serve a "dedicated use"?*

Electrical receptacles serving a dedicated use include those installed
for appliances, including refrigerators, ranges, and dishwashers, and
wall clocks. Floor electrical receptacles are also exempt. Communication
receptacles serving a dedicated use include phone jacks, data ports,
network and audio-visual connections. Electrical receptacles provided
for portable communication devices such as TTYs are not covered by this
exception and must comply.

*Do reach range requirements apply to elements or only to operable parts
of elements?*

Reach range requirements apply to the operable portions of elements,
including handles, controls, switches, buttons, control pads and other
mechanisms that must be activated or manipulated for use. Non-operable
portions of elements do not have to be within accessible reach ranges.

*Must operable parts be usable with a closed fist?*

Closed-fist operation is a good performance test but is not required by
the standards. Many types of operable parts, such as pull handles,
satisfy the requirements even though they may not be operable with a
closed fist.

*Are turn-key locks prohibited by the standards?*

Key locks or key cards are not prohibited by the standards which apply
only to the fixed portions of operable parts. Similarly, items dispensed
by ATMs and fare machines, such as receipts, cash, fare cards, and
vending machine products are not covered by the standards.

[]{#po}Protruding Objects
-------------------------

![person using cane
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3po1.jpg){width="100"
height="101"}

This guide explains requirements in the [ABA
Standards](../aba-standards.html) for protruding objects.

### Protruding Objects \[[§F204](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F204%20Protruding%20Objects)\]

To prevent hazards to people with vision impairments, the standards
limit the projection of objects into circulation paths. These
requirements apply to all circulation paths and are not limited to
accessible routes. Circulation paths include interior and exterior
walks, paths, hallways, courtyards, elevators, platform lifts, ramps,
stairways, and landings.

\
**Examples of Protruding Objects**

![Examples of protruding objects: sconces, handrails, cabinets, drinking
fountains and other elements that project into circulation paths).
Notes: These elements must comply with provisions for protruding objects
(unless they are located within cane sweep or above headroom clearance).
Requirements for protruding objects apply to all interior and exterior
circulation paths of sites. They are not limited to hallways and
corridors and apply equally to circulation paths in rooms and spaces.
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3po2-text.jpg){width="550"
height="522"}

### Protrusion Limits \[[§307.2](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#307%20Protruding%20Objects)\]

People with vision impairments often travel closely along walls which
can provide wayfinding cues sometime called a "shoreline." Objects
mounted on walls, partitions, columns, and other elements along
circulation paths can pose hazards unless their projection is limited.
Those with leading edges that are within cane sweep (27" high maximum)
or that provide minimum headroom clearance (80" minimum) do not pose
hazards and can protrude any amount.

**Limits of Protruding Objects**

![Wall-mounted objects with leading edges above 27" and less than 80"
are limited to a 4" max. projection (4 ½" max. for handrails). Notes and
labels: Protruding object limits apply to the full width of circulation
paths; Objects above headroom clearance can protrude any amount;
Protruding objects cannot reduce the minimum width of accessible routes;
Objects with leading edges within cane sweep can protrude any
amount.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3po3-text.jpg){width="550"
height="435"}

**![Protruding object located above another with leading edge 27\" max.
AFF. Note: 4" max projection can be measured from the leading edge of
fixed elements below objects that are within cane sweep
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3po4.jpg){width="300"
height="377"}**

**Location Above Detectable Elements**

Objects located above elements that are within cane sweep can protrude
4" maximum from the leading edge of such elements provided that any
required reach or clear floor space is not obstructed.

\
**![Pay phone with side partitions with bottom edge 27\" max. AFF. Note:
Partitions cannot obstruct required clear floor space or protrude into
knee and toe space
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3po5.jpg){width="300"
height="379"}**

**Side Partitions and Wing Walls**

Side partitions or panels and wing walls can also be used to make
protruding objects compliant. The bottom edge of panels or partitions
must be 27" high maximum.

\
 

  

\
**Recessed Objects**

Objects can be recessed in alcoves so that they do not project more than
4" into circulation paths. Alcoves must be sized to accommodate required
clear floor space at accessible elements.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **![Recessed drinking fountain with leading edge above 27\" AFF ](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3po6.jpg){width="261" height="350"}**       ****![Recessed drinking fountain in plan view projects 4\" max. from wall surface](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3po7.jpg){width="271" height="350"}** **
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Elements, such as wheelchair accessible drinking fountains, must provide
a knee clearance of at least 27". If located to provide, but not exceed
this clearance (27" above the floor or ground absolute), they are not
protruding objects because the leading edge will be within cane
detection.

![Hi-lo drinking fountain with higher unit enclosed by lower unit on one
site and a wall bump-out on the
other](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3po8.jpg){width="300"
height="314"}

*A wheelchair accessible unit located 27" absolute above the ground or
floor is cane detectable and can be used to enclose one side of high
units for standing access. In this instance, the 27" height is
effectively an absolute dimension because it is the minimum required for
knee clearance and the maximum specified for cane detection.*

### Post-Mounted Objects \[[§307.3](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#307%20Protruding%20Objects)\]

Free-standing objects with leading edges 27" to 80" high that are
mounted on posts or pylons cannot protrude more than 12" into
circulation paths. The 12" limit also applies to the clearance between
multiple posts (excluding the sloping portions of handrails).

![Post-mounted objects with leading edges 27\" to 80\" high protruding
12\" max. from post or pylon; second image shows object on two posts
with same protrusion limits and 12\" max. distance between
posts](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3po9.jpg){width="550"
height="317"}

Objects with leading edges 27" maximum or above 80" can protrude any
amount from posts or pylons.

](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3po10.jpg){width="550"
height="332"}

### Vertical Clearance \[[§307.4](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#307%20Protruding%20Objects)\]

Headroom clearance of at least 80" high is required along all
circulation paths (except at doors and doorways where a 78" minimum
clearance is permitted to accommodate door stops and closers).

Fixed barriers, such as guardrails, are required where the vertical
clearance is less than 80" such as at open stairways and along sloped or
curved walls. Barriers must have leading edges no higher than 27" so
that they are within cane sweep. Fixed planters, benches, and other
elements can be used instead of guardrails.

\
**Barriers at Circulation Areas with Reduced Vertical Clearance**

It is recommended that barriers be high enough so that they are not mistaken for a step or other change in level and do not pose a tripping hazard.

###  

### ![question mark](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/ques.jpg){width="100" height="100"}

### Common Questions

*Are requirements for protruding objects limited to hallways and
corridors?*

No, requirements for protruding objects apply to all circulation paths,
including those in rooms and spaces off corridors. They apply to both
interior and exterior circulation paths.

*Do drinking fountains pose hazards as protruding objects?*

Cantilevered units at standard heights for people who stand must be
recessed or protected as protruding objects. This is not required for
wheelchair accessible units with no more than a 27" clearance below (the
minimum required for knee clearance and the maximum recognized for cane
detection).

*Can curbs be used to indicate areas with less than 80" of vertical
clearance?*

The standards specify a maximum height (27") for the leading edge of
barriers so they are within cane sweep, but a minimum height is not
specified. Curbs may be mistaken for a step or change in level, instead
of a barrier. For this reason, barriers significantly higher than a curb
or riser, such as a guardrail, planter box, bench, parapet wall, or
similar elements are recommended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### []{#ar20621}Where Required: Site Arrival Points \[[§F206.2.1](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F206%20Accessible%20Routes)\]

At least one accessible route must be provided within the site to
accessible facility entrances from these site arrival points, where
provided:

-   accessible parking and accessible passenger loading zones
-   public streets and sidewalks
-   each public transportation stop.

**Accessible Routes from Site Arrival Points \[§206.2.1\]**

![Figure of site with accessible routes shown leading from public
sidewalk, parking, and bus stop top facility entrance. Notes: Site
arrival points include accessible parking spaces and accessible
passenger loading zones, public transit stops located on sites, and
public streets and sidewalks. An accessible route must connect site
arrival points to each accessible entrance they serve. Accessible routes
must coincide with, or be in the same vicinity as, general circulation
paths (§206.3). If no pedestrian route onto a site is provided and site
entry is by vehicle only, an accessible route from the site boundary is
not required (§206.2.1, Ex. 2). Where a vehicular way does provide
pedestrian access, such as a shopping center parking lot, an accessible
route is required.

Connecting accessible routes to public streets and sidewalks may require
coordination with local jurisdictions. Parking and Passenger Loading
Zones - Accessible routes must connect to access aisles serving
accessible parking spaces and accessible passenger loading zones. It is
advisable, though not required, to locate accessible routes in front of
parking spaces instead of behind them. Accessible routes that cross or
overlap vehicular ways are not required to be marked as a crossing (but
access aisles at accessible parking spaces and passenger loading zones
must be marked). Public Transportation Stops - Accessible routes serving
public transportation stops must connect to boarding and alighting areas

### **[]{#ar20622}Accessible Routes within a Site **\[[§F206.2.2](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F206%20Accessible%20Routes)\]

At least one accessible route within the boundary of the site
originating from site arrival points must connect all accessible
buildings, facilities, elements, and spaces on a site.

**Accessible Routes (Exterior) within a Site**

### ![Exterior accessible routes at a site with multiple buildings. Notes: An accessible route must connect site arrival points such as accessible parking spaces, passenger loading zones, and transportation stops to each accessible facility they serve. An accessible route within the boundary of the site must connect each facility on a site (except those connected only by a vehicular way that does not provide pedestrian access). An accessible route from public streets and sidewalks must connect directly or indirectly to all accessible facilities and elements on a site. An accessible route must serve all accessible spaces and elements on a site, including those that are exterior, such as courtyards and drinking fountains. An accessible route is not required where the only means of access between buildings, facilities, or elements is a vehicular way not providing pedestrian access (§206.2.2, Ex.). Accessible routes must coincide with, or be in the same area as, circulation paths. This promotes equivalency and precludes accessible routes that are obscure, hard to find, or that diverge from circulation paths more than is necessary (§206.3).](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4ar4ab.jpg){width="625"}

###   []{#ar2062}Accessible Routes within a Building or Facility

At least one accessible route must connect all accessible spaces and
elements.  If a circulation path is interior, the accessible route also
must be interior.  Accessible vertical interior circulation must be in
the same area as stairs and escalators, not isolated in the back of the
facility.

![Accessible route extending from ramp and connecting to maneuvering
clearance at door and clear floor space at a drinking fountain and an

is required to each accessible room, space, and element. Vertical access
between stories is required in most multi-story facilities, but
exceptions are permitted for some non-governmental facilities under a
certain size or number of stories. Accessible routes must serve each
level on a floor required to be accessible. Vertical access can be
achieved by ramps, curb ramps, elevators or, where permitted, platform
lifts. Accessible routes must connect to an unobstructed side of the
clear floor space required at accessible
elements.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4ar5.jpg){width="550"

  *![alterations icon](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/alt.jpg){width="75" height="75"}*   In alterations, an accessible route is required where circulation paths are altered or built (§F202.3).  Also, alterations to areas containing a primary function (a major activity for which a facility is intended) require an accessible path of travel that extends to site arrival points to the extent that the additional cost does not exceed 20% (§F202.4). Otherwise, if a space or element is altered, but the circulation path to it is not, an accessible route is not required.

### Where Required: Multi-Story Buildings and Facilities \[[§F206.2.3](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F206%20Accessible%20Routes)\]

An accessible route must connect each story and mezzanine in a facility
unless an exception applies. However, if a building does qualify for an
exception in the Standards:

-   all other provisions in the Standards still apply to stories and
    mezzanines not served by an accessible route
-   elevators provided anyway must fully comply (as standard or LULA
    elevators)
-   vertical access still may be required by an applicable state or
    local code.

An accessible route between stories is required in multi-story
facilities except those with no more than two stories where the
inaccessible story above (or below) the entry level has no public use
space and an occupant load of five maximum.

**Mezzanines (Private and Public Sector Facilities) \[§2F06.2.4, Ex.
3\]**

An accessible route must serve mezzanines in multi-story facilities
where vertical access between stories is required or provided. An
accessible route to mezzanines is not required in:

-   single story facilities (mezzanines do not count as a story) or
-   facilities that are exempt from the requirement for an accessible
    route between stories (additional conditions apply to restaurants
    and cafeterias).

![Facility with mezzanine. Caption: Exception: Mezzanines in
single-story facilities and facilities where an accessible route between

In alterations to multi-story facilities, an accessible route to stories
and mezzanines is required where a stair or escalator is provided where
none existed previously and major structural modifications are necessary
(§F206.2.3.1). The accessible route must connect each level served by
the new stair or escalator (except where a compliant connecting
accessible route already exists).

An accessible route to stories or mezzanines may be required as part of
an accessible path of travel to primary function areas that are altered
(§F202.4). Alterations involving primary function areas must include an
accessible path of travel that extends to site arrival points to the
extent that the cost is not "disproportionate" (i.e., more than 20% of
the total cost of alterations to the primary function area).

Exceptions for accessible routes between stories and to mezzanines
permitted in new construction apply fully to alterations, including
those that trigger an accessible path of travel to a primary function
area.

**Required in Alterations or Additions**

 ![Building schematic with stairways highlighted and route to primary
function area on upper floor highlighted. Notes: Where stairs or
escalators are added where none existed previously and major structural
modifications are necessary, accessible routes must connect each level

achieve an accessible path of travel to a primary function area that is
altered or that is part of an addition, unless the cost is more than 20%

An accessible route must connect accessible facility entrances with all
accessible spaces and elements in a facility that are connected by a
circulation path (§F206.2.4). Exceptions for accessible routes to
stories and mezzanines (§F206.2.3 and §F206.2.4, Ex. 3) do not extend to
level changes within a story or mezzanine that are part of a required
accessible route to spaces or elements.  These exceptions apply only to

### []{#ar402}Accessible Routes \[[§402](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#402%20Accessible%20Routes)\]

Components of accessible routes include walking surfaces, doorways,
ramps, curb ramps, elevators, and, where permitted, platform lifts.

**Components of Accessible Routes**

![Accessible route extends from ramp to door and elevator. Handrail
shown along a portion of the route. Notes: Doors, Doorways, and Gates
(§404). Doors, doorways, and gates along accessible routes and to
accessible spaces must comply. Vertical Access (§405 - §410) Changes in
level great than ½" must be spanned by ramps, curb ramps, or elevators.
Platform lifts are allowed only in certain specified locations and in
alterations. Handrails (§403.6) Handrails provided along walking
surfaces must comply (and are required at most ramps and stairs).
Limited Changes in Level (§403.4) Changes in level up to ½" must be
beveled (but can have a vertical edge if ¼" maximum). Walking Surface
Slope (§403.3) The running slope of walking surfaces cannot exceed 1:20
(5%), but other components of accessible routes, such as ramps and curb
ramps, can be more steeply sloped. Cross slopes must be 1:48 max.
Clearances (§403.5) The continuous clear width must be at least 36" (32"
min. for short distances, such as doorways), and additional clearances
are required for passing space and 180⁰ turns around narrow
obstructions. Surfaces (§403.2) All surfaces of accessible routes must
be firm, stable, and slip resistant. Carpeting and surface openings,
where provided, must comply.

** **\
**Clearances \[[§403.5](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#403%20Walking%20Surfaces)\]**

The minimum 36" continuous clear width of accessible routes can reduce
to 32" at points, such as doorways, for a maximum distance of 24".
 Greater clearance is required for 180 degree turns around narrow
obstructions and for wheelchair turning space.  The minimum clearance
cannot be reduced by any elements, including handrails or protruding
objects.

**180 Turns Around Obstructions**

Additional clearance is required at 180 degree turns around an element
that is less than 48" wide.  The clear width must be at least 48" at the
turn and 42" minimum approaching the turn (unless the clear width at the
turn is 60" minimum).

![Two alternative plan views are shown of an accessible route that has a
180 degree turn about an object less than 48 inches wide. In one figure,

**Handrails Along Walking Surfaces
**\[[§403.6](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#403%20Walking%20Surfaces)**, **[§505](../aba-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#505%20Handrails)\]****

Handrails are required at ramps with a rise greater than 6" and at
stairs that are part of a means of egress, but not at other locations.
 Where handrails are provided along other portions walking surfaces,
they must comply.  (Handrails provided in elevator cabs or on platform
lifts are not required to comply).

**Handrails along Walking Surfaces** 

-   ![Corridor with doorway and adjacent handrail.
    ](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4ar28.jpg){width="300"
    height="209"}34" -- 38" high measured to the top of the gripping
    surface.
-   Gripping surface must be continuous the full length and top and
    sides cannot be obstructed.
-   The bottom gripping surface can be obstructed up to 20% of the
    length (or along the full entire length when part of crash rails or
    bumper guards).
-   No sharp or abrasive elements on gripping surfaces or adjacent
    surfaces, and no rotation within fittings.

Surface requirements and clearances facilitate a power grip along the
length of handrails.   Handrails can have circular or non-circular
cross-sections, but must have rounded edges.  The gripping surface and
adjacent surfaces must be free of abrasive or sharp elements.

**Circular Cross Section and Clearance (§505.5, §505.7)**

**![Handrail circular cross section 1/1/4" to 2" in diameter with a 1 ½"

### []{#cq}Common Questions

 

*If no pedestrian route onto a site is provided, is an accessible route
still required?*

An accessible route from the boundary of the site is not required where
the only means of site arrival is a vehicular way without pedestrian
access. Where vehicular ways are also intended to accommodate pedestrian
travel, such as a shopping center parking lot, an accessible route is
required.

*Do accessible routes that cross vehicular ways need to be marked as a
crossing?*

No, accessible routes that cross vehicular ways are not required by the
Standards to be marked as a crossing. The Standards only require access
aisles at accessible parking spaces and accessible passenger loading
zones to be marked. (Local codes and traffic laws may require crossings
to be marked).

*Do stories not required to be on an accessible route have to comply
with the Standards?*\
\
Yes, stories (and mezzanines) not connected by an accessible route must
still meet all other applicable requirements in the Standards. This
ensures access for people with disabilities who can use stairs and
facilitates compliance should vertical access be achieved through later
renovations or additions.

*Do basements count in determining a facility's story count?*

As defined in the Standards, a "story" pertains to those portions of
buildings "designed for human occupancy included between the upper
surface of a floor and upper surface of the floor or roof next above"
(§F106.5). A basement or other level below grade designed for human
occupancy (i.e., equipped with lighting, ventilation, and means of
egress) counts as a story. Basements or other levels not containing any
space designed for human occupancy are not considered stories under the
Standards.

*Is an accessible route required to rooftop levels?*

In facilities where an accessible route is required to each story
(§F206.2.3), an accessible route must serve rooftop levels that contain
public or common use spaces or elements that are required to be
accessible, such as sun decks, lounges, dining areas, bars, or swimming
pools.

*When alterations are made on an upper story of a facility, is vertical
access required?*

If an alteration includes installation of a stair or escalator where
none existed previously and involves major structural modifications, an
accessible route between levels served by the stair or escalator is
required (unless an accessible route already exists). If alterations are
made to a primary function area on an upper floor, an accessible path of
travel to the area is required to the extent that the cost is not
disproportionate (i.e., more than 20% of the cost of the overall
alteration). In any alteration, an accessible route between stories is
not required in a facility that qualifies for those exceptions permitted
in new construction based on the number of stories or square footage per
floor.

  --- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Security Barriers
\[[§F206.8](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F206%20Accessible%20Routes)\]**

Security bollards and screening devices at accessible entrances cannot
obstruct accessible routes or accessible means of egress.  Accessible
routes can be adjacent to metal detectors and other screening devices
that do not accommodate all people with disabilities, but the route must
be located so users can maintain an equivalent level of visual contact
with personal items.

**Restricted Entrances
\[[§F206.4.7](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F206%20Accessible%20Routes)\]**

If entrances are restricted to certain occupants on a controlled basis,
at least one must comply in addition to public entrances required to be
accessible.  This applies to those entrances where entry access is
verified by security personnel and is strictly limited to certain
occupants, but no one else, including guests or companions of authorized
individuals.  All other types of entrances, excluding service entrances,
are considered "public entrances" under the Standards, including
employee-only entrances requiring keys or access cards or codes but that
lack the level of security of restricted entrances.

In alterations to existing facilities, accessible entrances are
required:

-   if an existing entrance is altered (and no fully compliant entrance
    already exists);
-   when entrances are newly added to a facility or as part of a
    facility addition; or
-   as necessary to achieve an accessible path of travel to primary
    function areas that are altered (unless disproportionate to the
    cost).

When alterations are made to primary function areas, a connecting
accessible path of travel from site arrival points is required to the
extent that it does not exceed more than 20% of the project cost.
Achieving an accessible entrance should be the top priority in providing
the accessible path of travel according to regulations implementing
these Standards.

Thick walls, casework, shelving, columns and other elements can cause
doors or gates to be recessed.  If any obstruction within 18" of the
latch side projects more than 8" from the face of a door or gate,
maneuvering clearances for a forward approach must be provided.  This
space must be inset at obstructions so that it is no more than 8" from
the face of the door or gate.

-   allow one-hand operation
-   not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist
-   operate with 5 lbf maximum
-   be located 34" to 48" above the floor or ground.

Hardware that can be operated with a loose grip or closed fist, such as
lever-shaped handles and U-shaped pulls, accommodates the greatest range
of users. (Closed-fist operation, while advisable, is not mandated by
the Standards). Round door knobs do not comply because they require
twisting of the wrist.

Latches and locks with small parts that must be manipulated can be
difficult to use and will not comply if pinching is necessary. However,
keys and access cards that are not part of the lockset are not required
to comply (but those that do not require pinching or turning provide
better access). Hardware that does not require simultaneous actions are
better, but some types, such as handles with thumb latches are
acceptable.

**Opening Force
\[[§404.2.9](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

The maximum 5 lbf opening force applies to all accessible doors and
gates except:

-   fire doors (minimum opening force allowed by code)
-   exterior hinged doors (no maximum specified)
-   latch bolts and other devices that keep doors or gates closed

The 5 lbf maximum applies to the continuous application of force
necessary to fully open a door, not the initial force needed to overcome
the door's seal resulting from unequal pressure. Latch bolts must be
retracted and other devices that keep doors or gates closed must be
disengaged prior to measuring the opening force. (Such devices, like
other door and gate hardware, must operate with a maximum 5 lbf force
(§404.2.7), but their operating force is not included in the measure of
door or gate opening force). Door pressure gauges and other products are
available to measure the opening force.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

| When using door gauges and other measuring devices, it is advisable   |
| to follow these steps (except where product instructions specify      |

| -   Place gauge immediately above door operating hardware about 2½"   |
|     from the latch edge of the door (approximately the centerline of  |
|     the door hardware)                                                |

height="228"}Opening Force of Exterior Doors**

The opening force of exterior swing doors is impacted by wind loading
and other exterior conditions, gasketing, HVAC systems, energy
efficiency, and the weight of doors. The minimum force needed to ensure
proper closure and positive latch usually exceeds the accessible limit
of 5 pounds of force (lbf) required at other doors. For this reason, a
maximum opening force for exterior hinged doors is not specified in the
Standards.

  ![design compass](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/compass.jpg){width="35" height="63"}*Recommendation:  *Automation of exterior doors is recommended, especially where the opening force is likely to be significant.  (At GSA facilities, automation of entrance doors is required by GSA's Public Building Service Standards.)  Otherwise, closers should be calibrated with the least force necessary for closure to minimize the opening force.  Difficulty opening manual entrance doors is a common access complaint.

![Detail of wheelchair user's feet and footrests at open door with
kickplate](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4edg24.jpg){width="300"
height="190"}The bottom surface of doors and gates on the push side must
be smooth to a height of at least 10".  This facilitates access since
mobility aids, including wheelchair footrests, are sometimes used to
push or prop open doors.  Kick plates can be used to help protect door
surfaces, but any gaps or cavities between the kick plate and the door
surface must be closed or capped.  Horizontal or vertical joints in this
surface cannot exceed a 1/16" variation in plane.

These requirements do not apply to:

-   Sliding doors
-   Doors and gates that do not extend to within 10" of the finish floor
    or ground
-   Existing doors or gates with kick plates (so long as cavities
    created by kick plates are capped)
-   Tempered glass doors without stiles if the top edge of the bottom
    rail or shoe is tapered at least 60⁰ from the horizontal.

height="103"}

-   visible signals for door bells or knocks are required in transient
    lodging guest rooms providing communication access (§806.3.2);
-   a hard-wired doorbell with visible signals is required at the
    primary entrance in dwelling units providing communication access,
    along with a means to visually identify visitors without opening the
    door, such as a vision panel or peephole (§809.5.5).

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![design compass](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/compass.jpg){width="35" height="63"}*Recommendation:  *Peepholes and other means of identifying visitors in mobility accessible guest rooms and dwelling units are not addressed by the Standards.  Products are available with prisms and optical lenses that do not require a close approach and can be easily used from standing and seated postures.  They are more effective than locating a regular peephole at a lower height which can impact visual identification of visitors.

### **[]{#ar4043}Automatic and Power-Assisted Doors and Gates **\[[§404.3](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]![Label: "Automatic Door -- Caution"](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4edg29.jpg){width="150" height="148"}

Doors are not required to be automated, but must comply when provided.
 The Standards apply industry Standards developed under protocols of the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and published by the
Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA).  The ANSI/BHMA
Standards address operating characteristics, including opening speed,
safety features, sensors and activation devices, and labeling, among
others.  Doors are classified by their type or level of automation.

**Power-Assisted Doors and Gates
\[[§404.3](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

Power-assisted devices reduce the opening force of doors with closing
mechanisms.\
They are activated by initial manual force, switches, or sensors. Most
reduce, but do not fully eliminate, the manual force needed to open a
door. For this reason, they must meet maneuvering clearance
requirements.

**Low Energy Doors and Gates \[§404.3\]**

Low energy doors and gates usually require activation by the user
through a push plate or control and are often used in moderate traffic
locations as an alternative to manual operation.  Most function like a
manual type but with a powered opener and closer option.

**Controls
\[[§404.3.5](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

Door and gate controls must be compliant as operable parts (operable
with one hand and without tight grasping, pinching, twisting of the
wrist, or more than 5 lbf). Clear floor space at controls must be
located outside the door swing to prevent users from getting hit by the
door.

\[[§404.3](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

Full-powered automatic doors and gates are often found in grocery and
retail stores, hotels, and airports to ease passage with shopping carts
or luggage.  Most are automatically activated by mats or overhead
sensors and do not require manual activation by users.

### ![question mark](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/ques.jpg){width="100" height="100"}

### []{#cq}Common Questions

*Must a primary entrance be accessible?*

The Standards require that primary entrances to dwelling units be
accessible. It is advisable, though not required, that access be
provided to the primary entrances of other types of facilities.

*Is there a maximum travel distance to entrances from parking and other
site arrival points?*

No, the Standards do not limit the travel distance to accessible
entrances. Accessible parking spaces must be located on the shortest
accessible route to an accessible entrance (relative to other spaces in
the parking facility). A quantitative travel distance between entrances
and site arrival points is not specified. In addition, accessible routes
must coincide with, or be located in the same area as, general
circulation paths.

*Is automation of doors required?*

Automation of doors is not required by the ABA Standards, but it is
highly recommended for entrance doors where the opening force is
significant. (GSA's Public Building Service Standards, which apply to
GSA facilities but not to other federal facilities, require automation
of exterior doors at accessible entrances.). A maximum opening force is
not specified in the ABA Standards for exterior hinged doors because of
the closing force typically necessary for ensuring positive latch
against wind loading, air pressure, and other conditions. This often
results in opening forces well above the 5 lbf maximum. Difficulty
opening exterior swing doors is a common complaint. Automation offers
the best solution. Otherwise, closers should be set with the minimum
force practicable.

*Do requirements for "public entrances" apply only to those entrances
used by the public?*

No, scoping provisions for accessible public entrances are not limited
to those used by the public. The term "public entrance" applies to all
entrances other than service or restricted entrances. "Restricted
entrances" are those available for common use (but not public use) on a
controlled basis. This is intended to apply specifically to entrances
where user identity is verified and entry is strictly limited to certain
occupants, but no one else, including guests or companions of authorized
individuals. Other types of entrances with lower levels of security,
including employee-only entrances requiring keys, keypads, or access
cards, are considered "public entrances."

*Are employee entrances required to be accessible?*

Where employee entrances meeting the definition of a "restricted
entrance" are provided, at least one must be accessible. Other types of
employee entrances must be accessible as "public entrances." In
facilities with separate visitor and employee entrances, access should
be dispersed so that accessible entrances serve both types of traffic.

*Are closet doors and pantry doors required to comply?*

Requirements for doors, doorways, and gates in §404 apply to those that
provide "user passage" (§F206.5). Doors serving walk-in closets or
pantries must comply. Doors to shallow closets or pantries, cabinets and
other storage elements not providing user passage do not have to comply
with provisions for doors, but must meet requirements for storage
(§811), including those for clear floor space and operable parts.

*Is compliance on both sides of a door or gate required when it is
usable only from one side?*

No, compliance is not required on both sides of those doors or gates
that can be used in one direction only. Compliance is required only on
the usable side. Examples include exit-only doors with no operating
hardware on the exterior side or separate enter and exit fare gates in
transit stations. However, if a door or gate is usable in both
directions, even occasionally, such as exit-only doors that may
automatically unlock in emergencies to be usable from both directions,
then compliance on both sides is required.

*Can handrails or other elements overlap door maneuvering clearances?*

No, door maneuvering clearances must be free of any overlapping objects,
even those providing knee and toe clearance, which can interfere with
maneuvering at doors and doorways. However, door maneuvering clearances
can be offset up to 8" from the face of the door or gate to accommodate
wall thickness, casework, shelves, or other elements adjacent to
doorways, including handrails. The door maneuvering clearance must be
measured from the leading edge of such elements so that the full
clearance is free of any obstruction.

*Is latch-side maneuvering clearance as specified in the Standards
applicable to doors with panic bars?*

When latch-side clearance is required as part of the maneuvering
clearances specified for a door, including on the push side of doors
with a forward approach that have both a closer and latch, it must be
provided at manual doors with panic bars as well. Latch-side clearance
not only provides proper positioning at door hardware but also
facilitates proceeding through doors against the force of closers.

*Are locks operated by keys prohibited due to the pinching or twisting
of the wrist their operation typically requires?*

No, non-fixed portions of door or gate hardware, including keys and
access cards, are not covered by the Standards, but those that can be
used without pinching or turning will provide easier access. Non-fixed
portions can be modified or adapted as needed for accessibility.

*Are spring hinges and gravity hinges considered "closers" in
determining the size of maneuvering clearances?*

No. Some approaches require additional maneuvering clearances when a
door or gate is equipped with a closer because of the additional force
that must be counteracted in proceeding through doors. Since spring and
gravity hinges do not significantly impact the opening force of doors,
they are not considered "closers" for purposes of specifying door
maneuvering clearance.

*Can maneuvering for a forward approach be provided when there is space
at least 60" deep in front of a door?*

Space at least 60" deep in front of a door that is unobstructed on
approach sides will provide sufficient depth for a forward approach if
appropriate strike-side clearance is provided; but in the case of
pull-side/ hinge-side approaches, greater latch-side clearance (36"
minimum) is still required because the minimum depth for this clearance
is 60" (54" if the latch-side clearance is at least 42").

height="300"}   *On the pull side of hinge approaches, 36" min.
latch-side clearance is required if the depth is 60" min.  (The depth
can be 54" min. if the latch-side clearance is at least 42".) *

 

* *

*Is additional latch side clearance required on the push side of doors
with a forward approach when either a latch or closer (but not both) is
provided?*

No, latch clearance 12" minimum is required for forward approaches on
the push-side of doors equipped with both a closer and a latch. If a
door has a closer but no latch, or a latch and no closer, no additional
latch side clearance is required (although providing the clearance is
helpful in maneuvering through doors with closers without latches). This
is also true for the additional depth required for hinge approaches on
the push side when both a closer and latch is provided. For latch
approaches, additional clearance is required on the push side and the
pull side when just a closer is provided.

*Are screen doors or storm doors considered "doors in series"?*

No, screen or storm doors are not considered "doors in series" since
they are part of the same doorway opening as the entry door. They are
not prohibited by the Standards but must meet all applicable
requirements for doors except those pertaining to doors in series.

*If a more recent edition of ANSI/BHMA Standards for automated doors is
issued should that be followed instead of those referenced?*

The specific editions of the ANSI/BHMA Standards referenced by the
Standards are to be followed (although the Access Board intends to
update references to keep them current). However, use of a later edition
of the ANSI/BHMA Standards may provide equivalent or greater
accessibility.

### []{#ar3034}Where Ramps and Curb Ramps are Required **\[[§303.4](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#303%20Changes%20in%20Level)\]**

Ramps and curb ramps are required along accessible routes to span
changes in level greater than ½".  Elevators and, under certain
specified conditions, platform lifts, can be used as an alternative.
 Portions of accessible routes with running slopes steeper than 5% also
must be treated as ramps.

Slope represents the proportion of vertical rise to horizontal length
and is specified in the Standards as a ratio (e.g., 1:12).  It also can
be expressed as a percentage, pitch, or in degrees.  The running slope
is to be uniform along a run, although slight variations may occur with
certain materials such as concrete.  No other changes in level other
than the running slope (1:12 max.) and cross slope (1:48 max.) are
permitted.  Variations in slope, such as grade breaks within runs, can
disrupt wheelchair travel.

**Clear Width
\[[§405.5](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#405%20Ramps)\]**

Ramp runs must have a clear width of 36" minimum (measured between
handrails where provided).  The width of ramps that are part of a means
of egress may further be determined by applicable life safety codes and
requirements for minimum exit widths greater than 36".

**Rise \[[§405.6](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#405%20Ramps)\]**

The height of runs is limited (30" max.), but there is no limit on the
number of runs a ramp may have. Long ramps with many runs can be
strenuous for people using manual wheelchairs.  While intermediate
landings offer resting points, they do not reduce the amount of effort
that must be exerted to negotiate multiple runs.

**Landings \[[§405.7](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#405%20Ramps)\]**

Level landings are required at the top and bottom of each run.  Changes
in level greater than 1:48 are not permitted at landings. Landings must
be designed to prevent the accumulation of water.

![Ramp with landings at top and bottom that are 60" long min. and at
least as wide as ramp run. Notes: Grade breaks (i.e., where the change
in slope occurs) must be perpendicular to the direction of ramp runs to

Intermediate landings between runs must be at least 60" wide clear and
60" long clear where ramps change direction (any change from linear).
 Handrails, edge protection, vertical posts and other elements cannot
obstruct or overlap the minimum 60" by 60" clearance.  The 12" minimum
handrail extensions required at the top and bottom of ramp runs must be
in the same direction of the run, but they can turn or wrap where
handrails are continuous at the inside turn of dogleg or switchback
ramps.![Ramp that changes direction with intermediate landing 60" min.

Required door maneuvering clearances can overlap ramp landings (it is
advisable to locate the swing of doors outside ramp landings for greater
safety).

Handrails are required on both sides of ramps with a rise greater than
6".  The Standards do not require lower handrails serving children
except at ramps serving play areas, but include a recommended height
(28" max.) and separation (9" min.) from the required handrail to
minimize entrapment hazards.

**Handrail Continuity and Extensions**

![Ramp handrail with extensions. Notes: Extensions 12" long min. in the
same direction of travel are required at the top and bottom of runs
(except for inside rail of switchback ramps) to provide support before
entering or exiting ramps. Bottom gripping surface can be obstructed up
to 20% of the length. Handrails must be continuous the full length of
run and tops and sides of gripping surface cannot be obstructed.
Extensions must return to guard, wall, or floor. The 12" min. is
measured to the start of the return radius. Extensions with a leading
edge 27" high max. can extend any amount from posts. Those with a
leading edge higher than 27" are limited to a 12" protrusion from posts
(§307.3). The sloping portion of handrails are not required to comply
with requirements for protruding objects.

Surface requirements and clearances facilitate a power grip along the
length of handrails. Handrails can have circular or non-circular
cross-sections, but must have rounded edges. The gripping surface and
adjacent surfaces must be free of abrasive or sharp elements.

**Circular Cross Section and Clearance (§505.5, §505.7)**

\
**Wet
Conditions **\[[§405.10](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#405%20Ramps)\]****

Landings subject to wet conditions must be designed to prevent the
accumulation of water.  Landings are permitted slopes not steeper than
1:48 to allow for drainage.

 

### []{#ar406}Curb Ramps **\[[§406](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#406%20Curb%20Ramps)\]**

Requirements for curb ramps apply to ramps that cut through curbs or are
built up to them.  New guidelines the Board is developing for public
rights-of-way will further address curb ramps located along public
streets and sidewalks, but they are not discussed in this guide.

**Curb Ramp Requirements \[§406\]**

\
**Top
Landing ****\[[§406.4](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#406%20Curb%20Ramps)\]******

The required landing at the top of curb ramps allows an accessible route
to connect to the ramp opening.  Side flares, where provided, are
intended primarily to prevent tripping hazards, not to accommodate
wheelchair maneuvering at ramps (except in alterations where sufficient
landing space is unavailable).  Side flare slopes cannot exceed 1:10
max. (or 1:12 max. in alterations where a top landing is unavailable).

**Alterations: Ramp without Top Landing**

height="397"}**

In alterations where sufficient landing space is not available, side
flares must be provided and cannot slope more than 1:12 to facilitate
wheelchair maneuvering.  Parallel curb ramps (page 12) provide an
alternative in such conditions.

\
**Top Landing Slope**

The maximum slope of the top landing is determined by the configuration
of connecting accessible routes.

**Sides of Curb Ramps
\[******[§406.3](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#406%20Curb%20Ramps)\]********

Curb ramps can have returned sides, but a top landing is required under
all conditions to allow maneuvering to and from the run.  

**Built-Up Curb Ramps **

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
**Built-Up Curb Ramps**

Built-up curb ramps are permitted, but they cannot project in parking
spaces, access aisles, or vehicle traffic lanes.  A top landing at least
36" deep is required at all built-up curb ramps.

**Built-Up Curb Ramp with Side Flares**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Parallel Curb Ramps**

Curb ramps can be oriented parallel to sidewalks.  This design provides
an option where limited space precludes a top landing.  A level landing
48" long minimum (60" preferred) accommodates maneuvering between runs
and right-angle turns to connecting routes, such as parking access
aisles and crossings.

![Parallel curb ramp with 48\" min. (60\" preferred) long landing at

height="322"}

**Curb Ramps at Intersections**

Curb ramps at marked crossings must be wholly contained within the
crosswalk, excluding side flares.  The Standards do not require
crossings to be marked or address how they are to be marked, but public
street crossings are addressed by the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD) for Streets and Highways.

![Pair of curb ramps at corner with top landings and ramp openings

flares)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4rcr27.jpg){width="600"
height="398"}

\
Curb ramps must be oriented so that the grade break is perpendicular to
the curb ramp run to ensure a smooth transition to streets, including at
corners with a wide radius.  The curb ramp opening can be aligned with
the curb line (left) or more directionally oriented to the crosswalk
(right).

marked crossings, where provided.  A segment of curb at least 24" long
beyond flares must be provided on both sides of curb ramps with side
flares within marked crossings.  This curb segment provides an orienting

**Raised Crossings**

![Raised crossing at least 36"
wide.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4rcr30.jpg){width="350"
height="308"}Raised crossings, where provided, eliminate the need for
curb ramps while serving to reduce traffic speeds.  Consult local
Standards for application requirements, including slope for vehicle
traffic, height, and markings.

**Islands \[[§406.7](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#406%20Curb%20Ramps)\]**

A 48" min. long separation is necessary between curb ramps so that
people using wheelchairs can clear one ramp before negotiating the next.
 Level cut-throughs provide an effective alternative, especially at
narrow islands that will not accommodate opposing curb ramps with a 48"
separation.

The ABA Standards do not require detectable warnings on curb ramps.
 However, they are required on curb ramps at transit facilities covered
by DOT's ADA Standards (facilities used by state and local governments
to provide designated public transportation services, such as rail
stations and bus stations).  DOT also requires detectable warnings on
curb ramps in projects funded by the Federal Highway Administration.
 New guidelines the Board is developing for public rights-of-way under
the ABA and ADA will address requirements for detectable warnings at
curb ramps and other transitions along public streets and sidewalks
where hazards to people with vision impairments are greater.

Where detectable warnings are required (or provided anyway) they must
meet specifications for size, spacing, and contrast.  These detailed
criteria provide a distinctive texture intended to have a uniform
meaning in alerting persons to the approach to vehicular areas (as well
as drop-offs along rail station platforms).

### ![question mark](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/ques.jpg){width="100" height="100"} []{#cq}Common Questions

* *

**Ramps**

*Is there a limit on the total length (number of runs) a ramp may have?*

No, the Standards limit the rise of each run (30" max.), but not the
overall length of ramps comprised of multiple runs. Since the usability
of ramps decreases with length, considerably long ramp systems should be
avoided where possible. (Ramps in play areas are limited to a 12" max.
rise).

*Are curved or circular ramps allowed?*

Ramps without level landings at changes in direction typically will not
meet the Standards due to resulting compound slopes. This includes most
circular or curved ramps, unless the radius is large enough so that the
cross slope is compliant and compound slopes are avoided. Otherwise, the
curvature and slope result in uneven surfaces that makes wheelchair
maneuvering difficult because not all wheels rest evenly on the surface.

*Can ramps be portable or provided after construction as an adaptation?*

All required ramps and curb ramps must be permanent and installed at the
time of construction or alteration with few exceptions. Ramps can be
provided after construction only to provide access to raised work
stations in courtrooms (sufficient space must be provided in design to
facilitate installation). Only ramps serving temporary structures can be
temporary or portable.

*Is there a maximum distance between ramp handrails?*

No, only a minimum (36") is required between handrails. The Standards do
not require center or intermediate handrails on wide ramps.

*Can handrails overlap ramp landings?*

Along runs and landings, the minimum clear width must be measured
between the leading edge of handrails. This also applies to landings
required to be at least 60" by 60" where ramps change directions so that
the minimum landing area remains clear.

*Can handrail extensions wrap or turn?*

Extensions are not required for continuous handrails along switchback or
dogleg ramps or at aisle ramps serving seating in assembly areas. In
alterations where the required extension would project hazardously into
circulation paths, they can turn, be shorter, or avoided. Otherwise,
handrail extensions must be in same direction as the ramp run.

*Can handrails be mounted to guard rails?*

Yes, handrails can be installed on guard rails if all applicable
requirements are met.

 

**Curb Ramps**

*Why is a top landing required at curb ramps if side flares are
provided?*

A landing at least 36" long at the top of curb ramps provides room to
approach or exit ramps and turn without encountering compound slopes of
flared sides. Side flares are intended mainly to prevent tripping
hazards. They are not designed to accommodate wheelchair maneuvering
except in alterations where space constraints preclude a compliant top
landing.

*Are side flares required at curb ramps?*

The ABA Standards do not require that curb ramps have side flares, but
limit the slope (1:10 max.) where they are provided. Side flares are
advisable where pedestrian traffic may cross runs to prevent tripping
hazards. Side flares are essential in alterations when space for a top
landing (36" deep min.) is not available; in this instance, side flares
(1:12 max. slope) are necessary to accommodate wheelchair maneuvering
that will partially occur at flares in the absence of full landing space
at the top unless a parallel-type curb ramp is provided.

*Are detectable warnings required on curb ramps or at hazardous
vehicular areas?*

The ABA Standards require detectable warnings along open drop-offs of
rail station boarding platforms, but they do not require detectable
warnings on curb ramps or at hazardous vehicular areas. However, DOT's
ADA Standards, which apply to public transportation facilities such as
rail stations and bus stations, do require detectable warnings on curb
ramps. In addition, DOT requires detectable warnings on curb ramps in
projects funded by the Federal Highway Administration. New guidelines
for public rights-of-ways issued by the Board under the ABA and ADA will
address detectable warnings on curb ramps and other transitions along
public streets and sidewalks

*Why are detectable warnings no longer required for all curb ramps or at
hazardous vehicular areas?*

In the last update, the ABA Standards were revised to focus more clearly
on facilities located on sites in recognition of separate criteria the
Access Board is developing for public rights-of-ways. The public
rights-of-way guidelines will address requirements for detectable
warnings due to hazards to people with vision impairments along public
streets and sidewalks. At facilities located on sites, various measures
can help reduce hazards, including reduced traffic speeds, marked
crossings with pedestrian right-of-way, and speed-bumps, and other
optional traffic calming measures.

### **[]{#ar2066}Required Compliance \[[§F206.6](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#f206%20Accessible%20Routes)\]**

Elevators are the typical means of providing an accessible route between
stories and to mezzanines.  In facilities not required to have an
accessible route between stories or to mezzanines (see the Accessible
Routes guide), a limited-use/ limited-application (LULA) elevator is
permitted.  LULAs also are allowed as an alternative to platform lifts
and private residence elevators.

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

**ASME A17.1 Code \[§407.1\] **\
*Elevators, including LULA and private residence elevators, must meet
the ASME A17.1 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators.  The ABA
Standards currently require compliance with the A17.1-2000, including
the 2002 and 2003 addenda. This edition must be followed until the
Standards are updated to reference a later edition of the ASME A17.1
code.  However, use of a later edition of the ASME A17.1 (now ASME
A17.1/CSA B44) may provide equivalent or greater accessibility.
 Questions about the ASME A17.1 code should be directed to the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers ([www.asme.org](http://www.asme.org)).*

Only passenger elevators as classified by the referenced elevator safety
code (ASME A17.1) can be used to meet the ABA Standards. Each passenger
elevator provided, whether required or not, must comply with the ABA
Standards. This includes those elevators that move both passengers and
freight, sometimes loosely referred to as "service elevators." Examples
include elevators in residential or retail facilities that are regularly
used by tenants or customers but that are also used to move furniture,
merchandise, or other freight.

Freight elevators cannot be used to satisfy the requirement for an
accessible route between floors. Freight elevators are defined by the
ASME A17.1 code as those elevators "used primarily for carrying freight
and on which only the operator and the persons necessary for unloading
and loading the freight are permitted to ride." Where provided, they are
not required to meet the ABA Standards. Construction elevators, like
other structures directly associated with the actual processes of
construction, are exempt (§F203.3).

  --- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ASME A17.1 code requires a two-way means of emergency communication
in elevator cars. This system establishes direct communication with
authorized personnel and must be activated by a push button. Handsets,
which are vulnerable to vandalism, and closed compartments are
prohibited. The activating button must be permanently identified by a
tactile phone symbol and the term "HELP" located either on or adjacent
to the button. Operating instructions are also required.

The ASME A17.1 also requires a visual signal, such as a labeled LED
light or lighted jewel, to acknowledge that the emergency call has been
received. The visual signal is considered a component of the two-way
communication, though voice communication may also be established. The
visual indication must be on the same panel as the "HELP" push button
and extinguish when a communications link is terminated.

In addition to the ASME requirements, the ABA Standards require that the
push button and other device controls comply as operable parts (§309).
They also require the push button to be labeled with a specified tactile
phone symbol and braille. Operating instructions and other information,
including the label for the visible signal, must meet criteria for
visual characters but are not required to be tactile.

### []{#ardo}Destination-Oriented Elevators

With destination-oriented elevators, passengers indicate the floor
destination when calling an elevator, usually through a keypad.  Lobby
indicators designate which car to use, which is programmed by the time
of arrival. This type of elevator reduces the number of stops per trip.
The requirements of §407 apply to destination-oriented elevators, but
some provisions or exceptions, which are summarized here, are unique to
this type of elevator.

operating panel is upgraded, at a minimum the new panel must comply.
Other elements of a car that are not altered are not required to comply.
Alterations made to an existing car also must be made to each elevator
programmed to respond to the same hall call so that a consistent level
of accessibility within banks is maintained.

Requirements for new elevators are also applied to those that are
altered, but specific exceptions or alternative specifications are
permitted for existing elevators that are altered. These provisions
unique to existing elevators are summarized here. In addition, altered
elevators must meet applicable sections of the referenced A17.1 code
that apply to alterations.

Provisions or exceptions specifically for existing elevators do not
apply to elevators that are newly added to an existing facility which
must comply with the requirements for new elevators. Certain alterations
to a facility may trigger the requirement for an accessible route
between floors, including:

-   where stairs or escalators are added in an alteration where none
    existed previously and major structural modifications are necessary,
    an accessible route must connect each level served by the new stair
    or escalator (§F206.2.3.1);

-   as needed to provide an accessible path of travel to a primary
    function area that is altered, unless the cost is more than 20% of
    the overall cost (§F202.4).

**Provisions or Exceptions Specific to Existing (Altered) Elevators**

**![Existing (altered) elevator car. Notes: Hall Signals (§407.2.2) -

### **[]{#ar408}Limited-Use/ Limited-Application Elevators **\[[§408](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#408%20Limited%20Use%20/%20Limited%20Application%20Elevators)\]****

LULA elevators are passenger elevators that are permitted in facilities
where an accessible route between stories or mezzanines is not required
and as an alternative to private residence elevators and platform lifts.
 They cannot substitute for elevators complying with §407 that are
required to meet requirements for accessible routes.  For the most part,
LULAs are held to the same requirements for elevators in §407 and
applicable sections of the ASME safety code.  However, LULAs have
smaller car sizes, slower speeds, shorter travel distances, and
alternative types of doors.  Besides car size, provisions for LULAs
differ from those of §407 in that:

-   Hoistway doors can be swinging type (they must open and close
    automatically, be power-operated, meet requirements for doors and
    referenced ANSI/BHMA Standards for low-energy doors, and remain open
    for at least 20 seconds)
-   Requirements are not included for door timing and delay or for car
    position indicators

**LULA Car Dimensions (§408.4)**

**![Figure one shows the configuration for new construction. The door
clear width is 32" minimum and the car width measured side to side is
42" minimum. The car depth is 54" minimum. Doors must be located on
narrow end. Second figure shows alternative dimensions of clear interior
space 51 by 51" minimum that are permitted if door clear width is36"
minimum. Third figure shows dimensions for existing LULA cars that are
altered: 36" minimum width, depth 54" minimum, and the net clear car
area is 15 square feet
minimum.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4epl16.jpg){width="600"

### []{#ar409}Private Residence Elevators **\[[§409](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#409%20Private%20Residence%20Elevators)\]**

Private residence elevators are permitted only within a residential
dwelling unit or in a multiple dwelling unit facility as a means of
access to a single private residence. Elevators in residential
facilities not located within or serving individual dwelling units must
meet requirements in §407.

\
![Private residence elevator. Notes: General (§409.1) - Automatic
operation; Compliance with the referenced ASME A17.1 standard. Call
Buttons (§409.2) - Compliant as operable parts, including reach range
and clear floor space, and ¾" min. in smallest dimension. Elevator Doors
(§409.3) - Car and hoistway doors/gates must be power operated and meet
the ANSI/BHMA standard for low-energy doors and other applicable
provisions for doors in §404 (compliance with maneuvering clearance on
push side of doors not required); Manual-open, self-close doors/gates
permitted for cars with more than 1 opening; Required location on narrow

candles min. at platform, controls, threshold, and landing sill; Car
controls must be raised or flush button, ¾" min. in smallest dimension,
comply as operable parts, and be located within accessible reach range
on side wall 12" min. from any adjacent wall; Telephone and emergency

### []{#arpl}Platform Lifts 

**Where Platform Lifts are
Permitted \[[§F206.7](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#f206%20Accessible%20Routes)\]**

Platform lifts can be part of an accessible route in existing facilities
that are altered. In new construction, platform lifts can be used to
provide an accessible route to these areas only:

-   wheelchair spaces, performance areas, and speakers' platforms
-   incidental spaces with a maximum occupancy of 5 that are not for
    public use
-   raised courtroom stations, such as jury boxes, witness stands,
    judges' benches, clerks stations and depressed areas such as the
    well of the court
-   levels within transient lodging guest rooms and residential dwelling
    units
-   certain recreation facilities: amusement rides, play areas,
    team/player seating areas in sports facilities, recreational boating
    facilities, and fishing piers and platforms

They also are permitted in new construction where topography or other
existing exterior site constraints make a ramp or elevator infeasible.
While the site constraint must reflect exterior conditions, the lift can
be installed in the interior of a building. For example, an exterior or
interior platform lift could be used to provide an accessible entrance
or to coordinate interior floor levels at a new building constructed
between and connected to two existing buildings if there is not
sufficient space to coordinate floor levels and also to provide ramped
entry from the public way.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![design compass](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/compass.jpg){width="25" height="45"}*Recommendation: * In alterations, it is advisable that platforms lifts be used only in instances where a ramp or elevator is technically infeasible or in the locations permitted in new construction.

**ASME A18.1 Safety Standard
\[[§410.1](../aba-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#410%20Platform%20Lifts)\]**

![ASME A18.1 Safety Standard for Platform Lifts and Stairway
Chairlifts](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4epl18.jpg){width="150"
height="199"}Platform lifts must meet the ASME A18.1 Safety Standard for
Platform Lifts and Stairway Chairlifts. The ASME A18.1 covers the
design, construction, installation, operation, inspection, testing,
maintenance and repair of lifts that are intended for transportation of
persons with disabilities.  The ABA Standards currently require
compliance with the 1999 edition or the 2003 editions of the A18.1
Standard.  Either of these editions must be followed until the ABA
Standards are updated to reference a later edition of the ASME A18.1
Standard.  However, use of a later edition of the ASME A18.1 may provide
equivalent or greater accessibility.  Questions about the ASME A18.1
code should be directed to the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers ([www.asme.org](http://www.asme.org)).

Under the ABA Standards, platform lifts must be independently operable
and must allow unassisted entry and exit from the lift. Attendant
operation, while allowed by the ASME A18.1 Standard, is prohibited by
the ABA Standards. Portable lifts do not satisfy the ABA Standards even
when they comply with ASME A18.1.

The ASME A18.1 Standard addresses requirements for runway enclosures,
electrical equipment and wiring, structural support, headroom clearance
(80" minimum), access ramps, pits, and other features. The ASME A18.1
Standard recognizes two types of platform lifts: vertical platform lifts
and inclined platform lifts. Lifts without platforms, including stairway
chairlifts, are not permitted by the ABA Standards except at swimming
pools and spas because they require transfer from wheeled mobility aids.
(Specifications for pool lifts include a fixed seat and footrests, but
not a platform (§1009.2)).

**Requirements for Platform Lifts**

![Platform lift requirements. Notes: Platforms (§410.2 - §410.4) -
Platforms must meet requirements for clear floor space and floor
surfaces, including changes in level, and the clearance between the
platform sill and edge of runway landing cannot exceed 1¼" (ASME A18.1
specifies 3/8" -- 3 /4"). Operable Parts (§410.5) - Controls must meet
requirements for operable parts, including reach ranges. Doors and Gates
§410.6) - Doors and gates must be power-operated, meet criteria for
low-energy doors, including the referenced ANSI/BHMA standard (§404.3),
and remain open for at least 20 seconds. (Self-closing manual types are
allowed at lifts with no more than 2 stops and doors/ gates on opposite
ends.) Standby Power (§F207.2) - Platform lifts permitted to be part of
an accessible means of egress by the referenced editions of the
International Building Code must be equipped with standby power.

### ![question mark](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/ques.jpg){width="100" height="100"} []{#cq}Common Questions

**Elevators**

*Are freight or service elevators required to comply?*

When an elevator is used to provide a required accessible route between
stories, it must meet requirements for passenger elevators. Elevators
that serve passengers but can also be used to move freight, sometimes
referred to as "service elevators," must meet the ASME requirements for
passenger elevators. Examples include elevators in residential or retail
facilities that are regularly used by tenants or customers but that are
also used to move furniture, merchandise, or other freight. Where
provided, they must comply with the Standards.

Freight elevators, on the other hand, are defined by the ASME A17.1 code
as those elevators "used primarily for carrying freight and on which
only the operator and the persons necessary for unloading and loading
the freight are permitted to ride." Freight elevators cannot be used in
lieu of a passenger elevator to provide an accessible route between
stories or mezzanines. Where provided, freight elevators are not
required to comply with the Standards.

*Can elevator doors close sooner than the minimum opening time specified
when users activate door close?*

User activation of door close (or automatic operation) cannot reduce the
initial opening time of doors (3 seconds minimum) or the minimum door
signal timing (based on 1.5/ ft/s travel speed for the distance from the
hall call button to car door centerline). When doors automatically
reopen due to a detected obstruction, they can begin to reclose when no
longer obstructed. The 20 second minimum pertains to the length of time
the sensory reopening device remains effective, not necessarily the
length of time doors remain open.

*Must elevator doors remain open for 20 seconds?*

LULA swing doors, private residence elevator doors, and platform lift
gates and doors must remain open for 20 seconds minimum. This does not
apply to the doors of passenger elevators complying with §407 which must
remain fully open for at least 3 seconds in response to a call
(§407.3.5). The opening time is further determined by the travel
distance from hall call buttons and signal timing based on a 1.5 ft/s
travel speed beginning from audible and visible signalization of car
arrival (§407.3.4). Reopening devices must remain effective for 20
seconds minimum, but in reopening, doors do not have to remain open for
this length of time if unobstructed.

*Are access key, card, or code entry systems permitted in elevators?*

Yes, but fixed features of such systems must comply as operable parts.
For example, card readers must be located within accessible reach
ranges. Non-fixed portions, including keys and access cards issued to
users, are not required to comply. (Where use of stairs between levels
served by an elevator is unrestricted, use of the elevator should not be
restricted to key holders.)

*Can audible signals for an elevator operate only when needed by a
passenger who needs them through activation of dedicated "accessibility"
control?*

No, audible (and visible) signals required for elevators must function
automatically at all times an elevator is operational. Requiring
passengers to manually activate such signals when needed is not
permitted by the ABA Standards.

*Can hall and in-car signals be displayed horizontally (i.e.,
side-by-side) instead of vertically (i.e., one above the other)?*

Yes, hall signs can be displayed horizontally instead of vertically.
However, with call buttons, the button designating the up direction must
be located above the one indicating the down direction (§407.2.1.4).

*Are handrails required in elevator cars?*

The ABA Standards do not require handrails in elevators cars. If they
are provided, they are not required to comply with requirements in the
ABA Standards for handrails (§403.6, Advisory).

*Can a more recent edition of the ASME A17.1 Safety Code for Elevators
and Escalators (or the ASME A18.1 Safety Standard for Platform Lifts and
Stairway Chairlifts) be used instead of the editions referenced in the
Standards?*

The specific editions of the ASME A17.1 and ASME A18.1 codes referenced
by the ABA Standards are to be followed (although the Access Board
intends to update references to keep them current). However, use of a
later edition may provide equivalent or greater accessibility.

\
**Platform Lifts**

*Are stairway chairlifts permitted?*

No, stairway chairlifts cannot be used where platform lifts are
permitted by the ABA Standards (§F206.7) although they are addressed by
the ASME A18.1 Standard. Chairlifts require transfer to a fixed seat
from wheeled mobility aids and thus are not independently usable.
Platform lifts can be equipped with seats, including those that fold,
but they must be located outside the minimum clear area specified for
platforms which are sized to accommodate wheeled mobility aids.

*Can platform lifts be locked?*

The Standards require "unassisted" entry and exit from lifts (§410.1).
Situations in which platform lifts are locked and require users to
request or retrieve a key for operation will not satisfy this
requirement for independent operation. Platform lifts can be locked
during those times when the space or facility they serve is closed.

*Can lifts be attendant-operated?*

Attendant operation, although recognized by the ASME A18.1 Standard, is
expressly prohibited by the ABA Standards. Platform lifts must provide
"unassisted entry and exit from the lift" (§410.1).

*Can platform lifts be portable or provided after construction as an
adaptation?*

Platform lifts must be permanent and installed at the time of
construction or alteration with few exceptions. Platform lifts can be
provided after construction only to provide access to raised work
stations in courtrooms (sufficient space and electrical service must be
provided in design to facilitate installation). Only platform lifts
serving temporary structures can be temporary or portable.

### []{#ar207}Required Compliance with the IBC \[[§F207](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F207%20Accessible%20Means%20of%20Egress)\]

Accessible means of egress must be provided according to the
International Building Code (IBC).  Issued by the International Code
Council (ICC), the IBC addresses the number of means of egress required
and technical criteria for them, including fire--resistance rating,
smoke protection, travel distance, width, and other features.  The
Standards currently apply the IBC 2003 edition or the 2000 edition and
2001 supplement.  The Access Board plans to update these references.
 Use of a later edition of the IBC may provide equivalent or greater
accessibility.

###  []{#armoe}Means of Egress

A means of egress is an unobstructed path to leave buildings,
structures, and spaces. A means of egress is comprised of exit access,
exit, and exit discharge.

**Components of a Means of Egress**

![Building schematic shows exit access as a path from any location in a
building to an exit; exits that are doors to leading to outside,
enclosed exit stairways, and horizontal exits; and exit discharge as a
path from an exit to a public way such as a street or
alley.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4amoe3.jpg){width="600"
height="325"} 

\
**Required Means of Egress \[IBC §1007.1 (2003), §1003.2.13 (2000)\]**

The IBC requires at least two means of egress from all spaces and
buildings with few exceptions. Some spaces and buildings are allowed to
have one means of egress if the travel distance to an exit is short and
the occupant load is low. For example, a business occupancy with no more
than 30 occupants and a maximum exit access travel distance of 75 feet
is permitted to have a single means of egress. More than two means of
egress are required where the occupant load is 500 or more (at least 3)
and 1,000 or more (at least 4). The IBC requirements for accessible
means of egress apply to new construction; accessible means of egress
are not required to be added in alterations to existing facilities.

An accessible means of egress, as defined by the IBC, is a "continuous
and unobstructed way of egress travel from any point in a building or
facility that provides an accessible route to an area of refuge, a
horizontal exit, or a public way." Where more than one means of egress
is required from any accessible space, each accessible portion of the
space must be served by at least two accessible means of egress.
Accessible spaces can be served by one accessible means of egress only
where the IBC permits one means of egress.

**Accessible Means of Egress**

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *Accessible spaces must be served by at least two accessible means of |
| egress with few exceptions. Accessible means of egress must extend    |

**Exit Access on Floors Above (or Below) the Level of Exit Discharge**

On floors above or below the level of exit discharge, accessible means
of egress must lead to exit stairways, horizontal exits, or to elevators
equipped with standby power.  These are locations where those unable to
use stairs can await assisted rescue by emergency responders.  It is
standard operating procedure for emergency responders to check these
locations first for anyone needing assistance.

**Accessible Means of Egress Leading to Exit Stairs**

 ![Building schematic shows two accessible means of egress extending

that address fire and smoke protection, ventilation, stairways and
handrails, signs, and other features.  The ABA Standards apply
requirements for stairways to each stair that is part of a required
means of egress (§F210).

**Exit Stairway Enclosures**

![Door leading to exit stairway enclosure with lighted exit sign above

The IBC requires illuminated exit signs at exits and exit access doors
where two or means of egress are required (§1101 (2003), §1003.2.10
(2000)). In addition, tactile exit signs are required at exit doors
leading to enclosed exit stairways and exit doors leading to outside.
The ABA Standards apply requirements for tactile and visual characters
to these signs (§F216.4.1), which can be met on the same sign or
separate signs. The IBC also requires signs on the interior of stairway
enclosures indicating the floor level and other information. Floor level
designations, where provided, must meet tactile and visual criteria in
the ABA Standards (§F216.2), but directional and informational signs are
subject only to provisions for visual characters (§F216.3). Door and
Gates - The IBC covers doors and gates serving means of egress (§1008
(2003), §1003.3.1 (2000)). The ABA Standards permit fire doors to have
the minimum opening force specified by the applicable life safety code
instead of the 5 lbf maximum otherwise specified for interior hinged
doors

**Areas of Refuge \[IBC §1007.6 (2003), §1003.2.13.5 (2000)\]**

Areas of refuge are fire-resistance and smoke protected areas where
those unable to use stairs can register a call for evacuation assistance
and await instructions or assistance.   They must provide direct access
to an exit stairway (or to an elevator equipped with standby power).
 Horizontal exits can substitute for areas of refuge.

**Features of Areas of Refuge**

posted instructions on use of the area under emergency conditions next
to the communication system and specifies required content. These
instructions must meet requirements for visual characters in the ABA
Standards (§F216.4.2, §703.5). Two-Way Emergency Communication System -
Devices must include audible and visual signals and connect to a central
control point (and to a public telephone system if the central control
point is not constantly attended) under the IBC. Their location must be
approved by the fire department. Operable parts are subject to the ABA
Standards (§309). Wheelchair Spaces - The IBC requires 1 wheelchair
space (30" min. by 48" min.) for every 200 occupants or portion thereof
served by the area of refuge. Spaces cannot reduce the required egress
width and must be entered directly from an accessible route or one
adjacent wheelchair space. Stairway Width - The IBC requires stairs
serving areas of refuge to have a clear width of 48" min. between
handrails to accommodate assisted

**Horizontal Exits \[IBC §1021 (2003), §1005.3.5 (2000)\]**

A horizontal exit compartmentalizes a building allowing occupants to
exit the area containing the origin of a fire into another portion of
the building that is protected by fire-resistance-rated assemblies
(doors, walls, ceilings, and floors).  A horizontal exit separates a
space into two exit access areas.  IBC requirements for horizontal exits
address fire-rated separation, opening protectives, capacity, and other
features.

**Horizontal Exit**

![Schematic of horizontal exit shows compliant fire wall or barrier with

height="300"}

**Horizontal Exit and Enclosed Exit Stairways**

![Plan view of horizontal exit and enclosed exit stairways. Notes: No
more than half the required exits can be horizontal exits. At least one
exit must lead directly to an exit enclosure or to the exterior. A 48"
min. stairway width is not required where horizontal exits are
provided.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4amoe17.jpg){width="600"

\
**Elevators with Standby Power \[IBC §1007.4 (2003), §1003.2.13.3

height="292"}

In buildings with four or more stories above or below the level of exit
discharge, at least one accessible means of egress must be an elevator
with standby power and emergency signaling devices.  Designed to remain
operational even when regular electrical service is lost, they are used
by emergency responders to move personnel and fire-fighting equipment
and to provide assisted rescue. Like all elevators, they are not to be
used independently by building occupants in emergencies.

  

![Building schematic shows floors served by exit stairway enclosure and
elevator with standby power. Notes: Only one of two accessible means of
egress can contain an elevator with standby power; In sprinklered
buildings, an elevator with standby power is not required on floors with
either a: horizontal exit (excluding floors below the level of exit
discharge); a compliant exit access
ramp.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4amoe19.jpg){width="600"
height="495"} 

 

**Exit Discharge \[IBC §1023 (2003), §1006 (2000)\]**

Accessible means of egress must connect exits to a public way, such as a
street or alley (i.e., space permanently deeded and dedicated to public
use).

**Exit Discharge**

**![Exit discharge shown as path leading from exit doors to public
way.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4amoe20.jpg){width="600"
height="299"}**

*Exit discharge is the path from an exit to a public way*

Steep terrain and other constraints can make it difficult to provide an
accessible means of egress from building exits to a public way.  The IBC
permits an exterior area for assisted rescue, a protected area
immediately outside a building exit, where a connecting accessible route
to a public way from the level of exit discharge is not practicable.
 Alternatively, an interior area of refuge can be provided at exits.
 When used as an alternative to an accessible route from exit discharge
to a public way, they must be provided, including in buildings that are
sprinklered.

**Signs \[ADA
Standards **[§F216](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F216%20Signs), **[§703](../aba-standards/chapter-7-communication-elements-and-features.html#703%20Signs)\]******

The ABA Standards cover tactile and visual features of signs, including
those that serve means of egress.  Only certain signs are subject to
requirements for tactile and visual access, while a broader range is
subject to the visual criteria only.  Tactile signs must include
compliant raised characters and braille characters and be located at
doors 48" to 60" above the floor or ground (§703.2).  Visual criteria
address the height, style, proportion, and spacing of characters, as
well as finish and contrast, line spacing, and other features (§703.5).
 Tactile and visual requirements can be met on the same sign or on
separate signs.

**Tactile and Visual Signs \[ADA
Standards ****[§F216.2](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F216%20Signs), ****[§F216.4.1](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F216%20Signs)\]**********

The IBC requires exits and exit access doors to be marked by illuminated
exit signs (§1011, §1003.2.10). In addition, the IBC requires a tactile
"EXIT" sign adjacent to the door to an egress stairway, an exit
passageway, and the exit discharge (§1011.3, §1003.2.10.3 -- 2000
addresses doors to egress stairways only). The ABA Standards include a
similar requirement for visual and tactile exit signs at doors at exit
stairways, exit passageways, and exit discharge (§F216.4.1). (An exit
passageway is a horizontal component of an exit that is separated from
interior building spaces by fire-resistance-rated construction that
leads to the exit discharge or public way.)

The ABA Standards also require that signs identifying "permanent rooms
and spaces" meet tactile and visual criteria (§F216.2). This requirement
applies to signs identifying stairways, floor levels, and areas of
refuge.

**Examples of Signs Required to Meet Tactile and Visual Criteria**

 ![Example signs all caps in raised characters and braille: "EXIT,"
"LEVEL 2," "STAIRS" (with stairs symbol), and "AREA OF REFUGE" with

height="147"}

*Exit signs (located at exits) and signs identifying permanent spaces,
such as stairways, floor levels, and areas of refuge, are required to
meet tactile and visual criteria.  Signs providing direction to such
spaces and to exits must comply as visual signs, but not as tactile
signs.  Instructional content included on signs, such evacuation
instructions, also must meet visual criteria but not those for tactile
characters.*

**Visual Signs \[ADA

Signs providing direction to, or information about, interior rooms and
spaces must meet visual criteria in the ABA Standards, but are not
required to be tactile (§F216.3). This requirement applies to
information about spaces, such as rules of conduct and evacuation
instructions, exit route maps, and directional signs to exits and other
elements and spaces.\
\
The ABA Standards specifically apply these requirements to signs
providing directions to accessible means of egress required by the IBC
(§1007.7 (2003), §1003.2.13.6 (2000). The IBC requires that such signs
be provided at elevators serving accessible spaces and those exits that
do not provide an accessible means of egress. Other directional egress
signs provided, including egress route maps, also must meet requirements
for visual signs in the ABA Standards. In addition, the ABA Standards
apply the visual criteria to posted instructions in areas of refuge
required by the IBC (§F216.4.2).

**Examples of Signs Required to Meet Visual Criteria Only**

**![Example signs: "EXIT" with directional arrow, "IN CASE OF FIRE USE

**Fire Safety Evacuation Planning**

Fire safety evacuation planning is a critical component of life safety.
Evacuation plans and procedures should address the needs of all facility
occupants, including those with disabilities. Various products are
available that can facilitate assisted evacuation of people with
disabilities in emergencies. Mobility aids, such as emergency stair
travel devices, also known as evacuation chairs, are available to
transport people unable to use stairs. These devices are designed with
rollers, treads, and braking mechanisms that enable a person to be
transported down stairs with the assistance of another person. The
Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North
America (RESNA), [www.resna.org](http://www.resna.org), has developed
consensus Standards for emergency stair travel devices through the
American National Standards Institute (RESNA ED-1:2013 -- American
National Standard for Evacuation Devices -- Volume 1: Emergency Stair
Travel Devices Used by Individuals with Disabilities). It is important
that evacuation chairs be located so that they do not obstruct required
means of egress.

###  []{#cq}Common Questions

*Are exit doors usable only in one direction required to comply on both
sides?*

Under the ABA Standards, compliance is not required on both sides of
those doors or gates that can be used in one direction only, such as
exit-only doors. Compliance is required only on the usable side.
However, if a door or gate is usable in both directions, even
occasionally, such as exit-only doors that may automatically unlock in
emergencies to be usable from both directions, then compliance on both
sides is required.

*Can stair handrail extensions overlap door maneuvering clearances?*

No, handrails and other elements cannot overlap door maneuvering
clearances. However, the door maneuvering clearance can be offset up to
8" from the face of the door to accommodate wall thickness, casework,
handrails, moldings, and other elements at doorways.

*Are fire extinguishers required to comply with the ABA Standards?*

In general, elements that are not fixed or built in, including fire
extinguishers, are not required to comply with the ABA Standards.
(However, non-discrimination provisions in regulations issued under the
ABA may be pertinent to the usability of equipment and furnishings by
people with disabilities.) The ABA Standards apply to fixed elements,
such as a fire extinguisher cabinet, and require compliance with
applicable requirements, including those for operable parts and storage.
Fire hose cabinets and other elements used only by fire fighters are not
required to comply.

*Do limits on protruding objects apply to stairways?*

Yes, requirements for protruding objects are not limited to accessible
routes and apply to all circulation paths, including stairways and their
landings.

*When door vision lights are limited to 100 square inches by the fire
code, is compliance with the specified maximum height of 43" to the
bottom edge still required?*

Yes. The Standards do not exempt such doors from the requirement for
vision lights (§404.2.11). However, compliance is not required when the
lowest part of the vision light is more than 66" from the finish floor
or ground.

*Where can one get further information or technical assistance on the
IBC, including its requirements for means of egress?*

Technical assistance on the IBC is available from the International Code
Council (ICC) at (888) ICC-SAFE (422-7233) or by email at [[This email

### []{#number}Required Number \[[§F208](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F208%20Parking%20Spaces)\]

Accessible parking spaces are required for each parking facility on a
site, such as lots and garages.  Requirements apply equally to public
and employee or restricted parking.  On sites with multiple parking
facilities, the minimum number of accessible spaces must be calculated
separately for each parking facility instead of on the combined total of
parking spaces provided on the site.  At least one of every 6 accessible
spaces, or fraction of 6, in each parking facility must be sized to
accommodate vans.

**Accessible Parking on a Site**

![Site with building served by two separate lots in front and a
multi-level parking deck in the back. Notes: The required number of
accessible spaces, including van spaces, is calculated separately for
each parking lot and garage on a site. Accessible spaces must be
dispersed among accessible entrances and be located on the shortest
accessible route to the entrance they serve. Exception: Compliance is
not required for parking spaces used exclusively for buses, trucks,
other delivery vehicles, law enforcement vehicles, or vehicular impound
if accessible passenger loading zones are provided where such lots have
public access (§F208.1, Ex.).

  height="84"}**\
  Accessible spaces are required in parking facilities with valet parking because vehicles specially equipped for
  persons with disabilities may not be easily used by others.  Further, valet parking may not be available at all
  hours a parking facility is open.  An accessible passenger loading zone also is required at facilities with valet
  parking (§F209.4).

  --- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

**Alterations and Additions**

Accessible spaces are required where parking facilities are altered or
added.  The term 'alterations' includes resurfacing of vehicular ways
(§F106.5).  Resurfacing or resealing and projects that add new parking
spaces constitute alterations (or additions) and must include accessible
spaces as required in the scoping table.  Normal maintenance, such as
pothole repair, surface patching, or repainting in place existing
striping for a few spaces, is not considered an alteration except where
it affects a facility's usability.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Where parking serves multiple entrances to a facility, accessible spaces
must be dispersed among accessible entrances. (If the number of
accessible entrances exceeds the number of accessible spaces, additional
accessible spaces are not required). Accessible parking spaces must be
located on the shortest accessible route to an accessible entrance,
relative to other spaces in the same parking facility. A maximum travel
distance is not specified in the Standards.

Accessible spaces required for one parking facility can be located in
another if doing so results in substantially equal or better access in
terms of travel distance to an accessible entrance, parking fee, or user
conveniences such as protection from weather, better security and
lighting. The minimum number must still be determined separately for
each parking facility. Locating accessible spaces required for a parking
structure in a surface lot often will not qualify for this exception
because such a location typically offers less convenience, security, and
protection from the elements.

 

**Multiple Parking Facilities on a Site**

Scoping and dispersion requirements ensure access to all parking
facilities on a site, including large sites with many lots and garages,
such as airports, shopping malls, and campuses. The term "parking
facility" encompasses parking lots, as well as garages, decks, and other
parking structures. The minimum number of accessible parking spaces must
be determined separately for each parking facility.

Parking facilities are to be treated separately for scoping purposes if
they are either:

-   structurally different (e.g., surface lot versus parking garage or
    deck);
-   dedicated to, and separately serve, different facilities on a site;
-   segmented and separated by guard rails, fencing, or barriers,
    particularly where they serve different users; or
-   separated by streets or roadways (as opposed to drive aisles on a
    site).

Surface lots that are contiguous or that are segmented by landscaping or
drive aisles (i.e., vehicular passageways located within parking areas),
but not streets or roadways, typically can be treated as a single
parking facility.

**Example Site: Shopping Mall**

 ![Shopping mall with surface lot parking on all sides with one outer
building served by same lot and another outer building with a parking
lot separated from the mall parking areas by a raised sidewalk. Notes:
The parking lot serving the shopping mall (center) and store (lower
right) can be treated as one parking facility because the parking area
is not divided or separated. Accessible spaces must be dispersed and
located at different facilities and accessible entrances served by the
parking lot. This lot is treated as a separate parking facility because
it is divided from the surrounding lot by a raised sidewalk and is
dedicated to a specific building. Parking areas that are labeled (e.g.,
"Lot A") to help users locate their vehicles but that are part of the
same lot (i.e., not separated) do not have to be treated as separate
parking
facilities.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter5/5p6.jpg){width="600"

  *![design compass](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/compass.jpg){width="45" height="81"}Recommendation:*  Where spaces within the same parking facility are assigned or restricted to specific user groups, consider calculating the minimum number of spaces separately for each type of parking or proportionately dispersing accessible spaces based on the overall total across each type of parking to ensure sufficient access for all users.

The Standards apply to parking garages, including those provided below
grade.  At sites that also include surface lots, a garage is treated as
a separate parking facility for scoping purposes.

 

**Multi-Level Parking Garage with Direct Connections to Facility**

![Multi-Level parking garage with direct connections to adjacent

accessible entrance (§F206.4.2). Dispersing accessible spaces among
accessible entrances requires placement of non-van accessible spaces on
different levels. All van spaces can be grouped on one level (§F208.3,
Ex.
1).](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter5/5p8ab.jpg){width="500"

**Multi-Level Parking Garage Not Serving a Particular Facility**

Accessible spaces, including van spaces, must be located so that they
provide the same level of protection and security as other spaces in the
garage.  Locating accessible spaces required for a garage on the
exterior is not usually acceptable. \

**Hospital Outpatient Facilities
\[[§F208.2.1](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F208%20Parking%20Spaces)\]**

The Standards require a higher level of accessible parking at hospital
outpatient facilities.  At least 10% of patient and visitor parking
spaces that serve such facilities must comply.  This applies to those
units in hospitals that provide regular or continuing medical treatment
without overnight stay.  Other types of medical facilities not located
in hospitals, including doctors' offices and independent clinics, are
not subject to this requirement but to the regular scoping table.

**Accessible Parking at Outpatient Facilities in Hospitals**

 ![Hospital with outpatient facility highlighted and portion of parking
lot serving outpatient facility highlighted. Notes: 10% scoping required
for visitor/ patient parking serving hospital outpatient facilities.
Within a multi-use facility, the 10% requirement applies to the number
of visitor/ patient spaces intended to serve hospital outpatient
facilities. Most local zoning codes require parking spaces based on
facility square footage, occupant load, and occupancy and can be
consulted when determining the number of spaces serving outpatient
facilities. Spaces serving employees or other areas of a hospital are
subject to the regular scoping
table.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter5/5p12.jpg){width="550"

**Rehabilitation and Outpatient Physical Therapy Facilities
\[[§F208.2.2](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F208%20Parking%20Spaces)\]**

At least 20% of patient and visitor parking spaces must be accessible at
outpatient physical therapy facilities (including those not located at
hospitals) and at rehabilitation facilities that specialize in treating
conditions that affect mobility. Conditions affecting mobility include:

-   those involving the use of mobility aids and devices (braces, canes,
    crutches, prosthetic devices, wheelchairs, or powered mobility
    aids);
-   arthritic, neurological, or orthopedic conditions that severely
    limit one\'s ability to walk;
-   respiratory diseases and other conditions which may require the use
    of portable oxygen; or
-   cardiac and other conditions that impose substantial limitations on
    one's mobility.

Rehabilitation facilities that provide, but that do not specialize in,
services or treatment for persons with mobility impairments, such as
general rehabilitative therapy centers, are not subject to the 20%
requirement.  In mixed-use facilities, the 20% may be applied only to
the portion of spaces that are determined to serve the types of
rehabilitation or outpatient therapy facilities covered by this
provision.

Accessible parking at residential facilities is based on the ratio of
parking spaces to dwelling units.

**Parking at Residential Facilities**

![Parking at multi-family residential facility. Notes: Resident Parking

Those assigned to specific units are not required to be identified by
signs (§F216.5, Ex. 2). If the total number of resident spaces is less
than the total number of units, accessible parking is based on the
scoping table in F208.2 (but providing one accessible space for each
mobility accessible unit is advisable). Additional Resident Parking
(§F208.2.3.2) At least 2%, but no fewer than one, of resident parking
spaces provided in excess of the one per unit total must comply. These
spaces must be dispersed among all types of resident parking except
where substantially equal or greater accessibility is provided in terms
of distance from an accessible entrance, parking fee, and user
convenience (§F208.3.2, Ex). Visitor and Other Parking (§F208.2.3.3)
Parking spaces for guests, employees, or other non-residents are subject

(§502.4) Parking spaces and access aisles must meet requirements for
floor and ground surfaces (§302) and cannot have changes in level other
than slopes not exceeding 1:48. Markings (§502.1, §502.2, §502.3.3) Both
the parking space and access aisle must be marked. The marking method
and color is not specified in the Standards, but may be addressed by
state or local codes or regulations. Detail: width measured to
centerline of marking. Note: The width of spaces and aisles is measured
to the centerline of markings (but it can include the full width of
lines where there is no adjacent parking space or
aisles).](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter5/5p16.jpg){width="575"

### **[]{#van}Van Accessible Parking Spaces \[[§502.1 - 502.5](../aba-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#502%20Parking%20Spaces)\]![Person using wheelchair exiting van with ramp parking in accessible van space. ](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter5/5p17.jpg){width="200" height="148"}** {#van-accessible-parking-spaces-502.1---502.5person-using-wheelchair-exiting-van-with-ramp-parking-in-accessible-van-space. style="text-align: left;"}

At least one space for every 6 or fraction of 6 accessible spaces must
be van accessible.  Van spaces provide an additional 3 feet of width to
accommodate vehicles equipped with ramps or lifts. This extra space can
be added to either the parking space or to the access aisle.  A wider
access aisle saves space since two spaces can share one aisle, but wider
spaces can help prevent misuse of the access aisle as a parking space.

an access aisle is required for each space on the passenger side
(§502.3.4).  This is the side from which ramps and lifts typically
deploy.\

\[[§502.5](../aba-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#502%20Parking%20Spaces)\]**

A 98" minimum vertical clearance is required for van parking spaces/
access aisles and the vehicle route to these spaces from an entrance and
from these spaces to an exit.  Van spaces can be grouped on one level of
parking structures.

  ***![design compass](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/compass.jpg){width="25" height="45"}**Recommendation:*  Signs at garage entrances that indicate vertical clearances and the location of van spaces are advisable.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Pay Stations**

Pay stations and other elements that serve accessible parking spaces
must comply with requirements for operable parts (§309) and be served by
an accessible route.  Requirements for operable parts cover clear floor
space, operating characteristics, and location within accessible reach
ranges.  Operable parts that are used from inside vehicles, such as
garage ticket dispensers at vehicle entry, are not required to comply
with the Standards (although policies or practices may need to be
modified to accommodate persons with disabilities who are unable to use
such devices).

![Man using power chair at pay
station.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter5/5p22.jpg){width="400"

Requirements for operable parts include:

-   Clear floor space for a forward or side approach (§309.2)
-   Location within accessible reach ranges (§309.3)
-   One-hand operation without tight grasping, pinching, twisting of the
    wrist, or more than 5 pounds of force (§309.4)

height="331"}

Accessible spaces must be identified by signs with the International
Symbol of Accessibility (ISA) (§703.7.2.1). Signs identifying van spaces
must include the term "van accessible." This designation is informative
and does not restrict use of such spaces to van users only. No other
text or content is required by the Standards.

Signs must be at least 60" high measured to the bottom edge so that they
are visible while vehicles are parked in a space. Signs can be on posts,
or where feasible, on walls or suspended from ceilings (an 80" minimum
headroom clearance is required at signs suspended above circulation
paths (§307.4)). ISA designations on the parking surface, even if
required by a state or local government, cannot substitute for
above-ground signs that remain visible at all times.

State or local codes and regulations may address other sign
characteristics, including size, color, and additional content, such as
"reserved" or violation fines, but the ABA Standards do not.

**Electric Vehicle Charging Stations**

![electric vehicle charging station symbol
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter5/5p27.jpg){width="90"
height="90"}The Standards do not include specific provisions for
electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.  However, it is advisable to
address access to EV charging stations so that they are usable by people
with disabilities.  If provided, accessible spaces at EV charging
stations cannot count toward the minimum number of accessible car and
van parking spaces required in a parking facility.

![Accessible EV charging station. Notes: Recommendations: Provide access
to a reasonable number of spaces serving EV charging stations or use the
scoping table in §F208.2 to determine an appropriate number. (The number
of accessible spaces serving EV charging stations must be determined
separately from the required number of car and van parking spaces.)
Provide an accessible route on both sides of the vehicle space that
connects to the charging station for easier access. A vehicle space at
least 10' -- 13' wide is advisable. A 10' width offers an extra 2' that
effectively provides a 5' aisle on one side when paired with the
accessible route; a 13' wide space will allow an 8' aisle. This
flexibility is helpful since the parking direction is determined by the
location of the charging station and the vehicle connection. Use the
International Symbol of Accessibility only where spaces are reserved
exclusively for people with disabilities.

###  []{#cq}Common Questions {#common-questions-9 style="text-align: left;"}

**Scoping Requirements**

*Must the minimum number of spaces be determined separately for each
parking facility on a site or can it be based on the collective total of
spaces provided on a site?*

The minimum number of accessible parking spaces, including van
accessible spaces, must be calculated separately for each parking
facility on a site. Spaces required for one parking facility can be
provided in another where doing so results in equal or greater access
and convenience for users, but the required number must still be
calculated separately for each parking facility.

*Is accessible parking required on sites where no parking is intended?*

No, the ABA Standards require accessible spaces only where parking is
provided. They do not require accessible spaces where parking is not
provided at all. Most local and state codes and regulations address the
amount of parking required for a site.

*Are accessible spaces required in employee parking lots?*

Yes, the requirements for accessible parking spaces apply equally to
employee parking facilities and are not limited to visitor parking.
Where a parking facility contains parking spaces for visitors and spaces
reserved for employees only, it is important that sufficient access is
provided to both types of spaces. In this case, it is advisable to
calculate the minimum number separately for each type of space as though
they were separate parking facilities, but this is not required if they
are both located in the same parking lot or garage. Both accessible
visitor and employee spaces must be on the shortest accessible route to
an accessible entrance.

*Are accessible spaces required in temporary parking lots and in unpaved
lots, such as gravel or grass lots?*

Yes, the ABA Standards apply to both permanent and temporary facilities,
including parking facilities (§F201.3). In all parking facilities,
including gravel or grass lots, parking spaces and access aisles must be
marked and have firm, stable, and slip resistant surfaces as specified
for accessible ground and floor surfaces (§302).

*Is resurfacing of a lot considered an alteration?*

According to the definition of \"alteration,\" normal maintenance is not
considered an alteration unless it affects a facility's usability. For
example, if a lot is to be resurfaced or its plan reconfigured,
accessible spaces must be provided. However, work that is primarily
maintenance, such as surface patching, does not trigger a requirement
for accessible spaces. When the work is not considered an alteration,
providing accessible spaces is advisable where sufficient accessible
parking is lacking and may be necessary in meeting obligations for
program access under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

*Are accessible spaces required for tractor trailers at rest stops and
other facilities?*

No, the Standards exempt those spaces used exclusively for trucks, as
well as buses, other delivery vehicles, law enforcement vehicles, or
vehicular impound.

*How is access to be provided to spaces for recreational vehicles?*

The ABA Standards include requirements for outdoor developed areas on
federal lands such as camping and picnic facilities, trails, and beach
access routes. These provisions address access to RV and other parking
spaces at camping and picnic units as well as pull-up spaces at dump
stations, including space width (minimum 20', or 16' in the case of a
second adjoining space) and utility and sewage hook-ups (§1011 and
§1012). These provisions can be consulted for guidance in addressing
access to RV parking provided on other sites. At other types of sites
with both RV and regular parking spaces, scoping should be applied
separately to both types which will permit accessible RV spaces to be
located among other RV spaces so long as they are on the shortest
accessible route to facility entrances among such spaces.

*Are accessible parking spaces required on a site where valet service is
provided but vehicles are parked off site, such as in a public parking
garage or on public streets?*

Parking facilities with valet parking must provide accessible parking
spaces to allow self-parking by people with disabilities (and must also
provide an accessible passenger loading zone (§F209.4)). This applies
where parking spaces are provided on the same site as the valet parking
service. However, if valet parking service is provided on a site without
any parking spaces, accessible parking spaces are not required on the
site (but policies and practices to accommodate people with disabilities
must be in place under the Department of Justice's ADA regulations).
Public garages and other parking facilities subject to the Standards
must comply and provide accessible parking spaces in any case. If a
parking garage does not provide valet parking, or if valet parking
service is provided off site by a different entity that parks vehicles
in the garage, an accessible passenger loading zone is not required at
the garage.

\
**Location and Dispersion**

*Do the Standards specify a maximum travel distance between parking
spaces and facility entrances?*

No. The Standards require that accessible parking spaces be on the
shortest accessible route to an accessible entrance, but they do not
specify a maximum travel distance, nor do they require that parking be
installed where none is planned (e.g., directly in front of an
entrance).

*Can accessible spaces required for one parking facility be located in
another one instead?*

Accessible spaces required for one parking facility can be located in a
different parking facility on the site if it results in substantially
equal or greater access and convenience for users. (§F208.3.1, Ex. 2).
The term "user convenience" applies to factors such as protection from
the weather, security, lighting, and comparative maintenance.

*Can van spaces required for a parking garage be located in a surface
lot instead?*

No. Accessible parking, including van spaces, required for one parking
facility can be located in another parking facility only where it
results in substantially equal or greater access and convenience for
users. Open lots do not provide the same level of protection, security,
and lighting as garage parking.

*Is vertical access required to all levels of a parking garage?*

It depends. The Standards require that an accessible route connect each
story in "multi-story" facilities but include certain exceptions based
on the number of stories or the square footage per floor (§F206.2.3). As
defined in the Standards, a "story" contains space for "human occupancy"
(i.e., equipped with ventilation, light, and means of egress). Levels of
open parking structures that do not contain occupiable space are not
considered "stories" under the Standards. However, an accessible route
must connect all accessible parking spaces to the accessible entrances
they serve as well as any other elements or spaces required to be
accessible. Vertical access must be provided as necessary to address any
changes in level along these required accessible routes. For example, in
underground parking garages, elevators or, where feasible, pedestrian
ramps, are necessary to provide an accessible route from parking levels
with accessible spaces to the facility they serve.

*Are accessible spaces required on all levels of a multi-level parking
structure?*

It depends. If a parking facility has entrances and exits on one level
only, standard and van accessible spaces are required on that level so
that they are on the shortest accessible route to the entrance/exit.
However, where a parking facility has entrances/exits or direct
connections to an adjacent building on multiple levels, standard
accessible spaces must be dispersed among accessible entrances on
different levels, but van spaces can be grouped on one level under all
conditions (§F208.3.1, Ex. 1).

\
**Technical Requirements**

*Can accessible routes run behind other parking spaces?*

The ABA Standards require that an accessible route connect parking space
access aisles to the accessible entrance they serve but they do not
specifically prohibit the accessible route from running behind parking
spaces. However, it is recommended that accessible routes be configured
so that they run in front of parking spaces for greater safety.

*Are bollards, poles, columns, or other elements permitted within the
marked area of access aisles?*

No elements, including bollards, columns, or poles, can encroach into
the defined area of access aisles. (The width of spaces and aisles is
measured to the centerline of markings but can include the full line
width where there is no adjacent parking space or aisle).

*Must accessible routes or crossings be marked?*

No. The ABA Standards require accessible parking spaces and access
aisles to be marked, but they do not require accessible routes,
including portions crossing vehicular ways, to be marked.

*How are parking spaces and access aisles to be marked?*

The ABA Standards do not specify the method or color of parking space
and access aisle markings. State or local codes and regulations may
specify such markings. It is important that access aisles be marked in a
manner that discourages parking in them, especially those that are 8
feet wide at van spaces.

*What are the requirements for the size and color of signs?*

The ABA Standards require accessible spaces to be designated by the
International Symbol of Accessibility. In addition, van spaces must be
labeled by the term "van accessible." The Standards do not specify sign
color, size, or other characteristics. Signs may be subject to
additional specifications under applicable state or local requirements
or the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices published by the
Federal Highway Administration.

*Can surface decals substitute for post- or wall-mounted signs?*

No, the Standards require signs identifying accessible parking spaces
that are at least 60" high measured to the bottom edge of the sign so
that they are visible when a vehicle is parked in the space. Surface
decals or other identifying features may be required by local or state
codes and can be provided in addition to, but not in place of, signs
required by the ABA Standards.

*Is front-in only or angled parking prohibited for accessible parking
spaces?*

No, the ABA Standards do not prohibit front-in only, back-in only, or
angled parking spaces. However, where van spaces are angled, the
Standards require the access aisle to be located on the passenger side
which is the side where vehicle ramps and lifts are typically deployed.
Since users pull in or back in depending on which side the access aisle
is needed, it is advisable to design both regular and van accessible
spaces so that they can be entered in either direction. Otherwise,
consider providing one access aisle at each regular accessible space
instead of allowing two spaces to share an aisle so that access is
available on both sides.

*Can accessible spaces be parallel instead of perpendicular?*

The Standards do not specifically require that accessible spaces be
perpendicular instead of parallel, but perpendicular parking spaces are
preferred at facilities located on sites because most allow users to
park facing in or out depending on the side that the access aisle is
needed. If accessible parking spaces at facilities located on sites (as
opposed to those located along public streets) are parallel, they must
fully comply with all applicable requirements, including those for
access aisles and for van spaces.

*Must van accessible spaces be restricted to van use?*

No. The required \"van-accessible\" designation is informative, not
restrictive, in identifying those spaces that are better suited for van
use and does not restrict the use of spaces to vans only. State or local
codes and regulations may require additional verbiage, but the ABA
Standards do not. Additional content on van designation signs can
recommend that car drivers not use the space unless no other accessible
parking space is available.

*Do the surface requirements, including those for maximum slope (1:48),
apply to all portions of a parking lot?*

No, the surface criteria apply only to accessible parking spaces, access
aisles, and accessible routes, including those serving other elements or
spaces besides parking spaces. Transitions to these areas from other
portions of lots should be smooth to prevent tripping hazards.

aisle must be at least 60" wide, extend the full length of the vehicle
pull-up space, adjoin an accessible route, and cannot overlap vehicular
ways. The marking method and color is not specified. Surfaces (§503.4)
Vehicle pull-up spaces and access aisles must meet requirements for
ground and floor surfaces (§302) and cannot have changes in level other
than slopes not steeper than 1:48. Curb ramps cannot overlap access
aisles or vehicle pull-up spaces. Vertical Clearance (§503.5) A vertical
clearance of 114" is required at the vehicle pull-up space and access
aisle and along a vehicular route connecting them to a vehicle entrance
and exit. Accessible passenger loading zones are not required to be
identified by the International Symbol of Accessibility.

**Bus Loading Areas and On-Street Bus Stops
\[[§F209.2.2](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F209%20Passenger%20Loading%20Zones%20and%20Bus%20Stops)
and
[§F209.2.3](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F209%20Passenger%20Loading%20Zones%20and%20Bus%20Stops)\]**

Loading zones designed for buses that provide general or special
service, including charter service, to the public on a regular and
continuing basis are required to comply with provisions for bus boarding
and alighting areas (§810.2) in the transportation facility section of
the Standards.  This includes bus service provided by public transit
agencies and other state or local government entities, excluding public
school transportation (referred to as "designated public transportation"
in ADA regulations issued by the Department of Transportation (DOT)).
 It also applies to those serving tour, charter, and shuttle buses
operated by private entities (referred to as "specified public
transportation" in DOT's regulations).  On-street bus stops also must
comply with requirements in §810.2 to the maximum extent practicable.

### []{#cq}Common Questions {#common-questions-10 style="text-align: left;"}

 

*Are accessible passenger loading zones required on sites where no
passenger loading zone is intended?*

Accessible passenger loading zones are required at these sites whether
or not passenger loading zones are planned: parking facilities that
provide valet parking, licensed medical care and long term care
facilities where the period of stay exceeds 24 hours, and mechanical
access parking garages. At all other facilities, the requirements apply
only where passenger loading zones are provided.

*What constitutes a "passenger loading zone"?*

Only those areas that are specifically designed or designated for
passenger loading are considered "passenger loading zones" under the
Standards. This includes those passenger drop-off or pick-up areas
commonly found at airports, convention centers, schools, and many hotel
entrances that have design features, signs, or markings indicating
passenger loading zones. At other locations, compliance is not required
even if passenger loading may occasionally occur, but is not
specifically intended or reflected in the design.

*What distinguishes passenger loading zones from bus loading zones?*

Requirements for passenger loading zones (§F209.2.1) apply to any
passenger loading areas except those that exclusively serve buses
providing designated or specified public transportation as defined by
DOT's ADA regulations, including charter service, which are subject to
criteria for bus loading zones (§F209.2.2) or on-street-bus stops
(§F209.2.3). For example, at an airport, passenger drop-off and pick-up
areas serving cars, taxis, limousines, vans, and other vehicles are
treated as passenger loading zones, while stops exclusively serving
public transit buses, hotel buses, and other types of buses providing
designated or specified public transportation must meet criteria for bus
loading zones.

*If a passenger loading area serves cars and vans, as well as buses,
must the provisions for passenger loading zones and bus loading zones
both be satisfied?*

No, provisions for bus loading zones (§810.2) apply only to on-street
bus stops and those bus loading zones that exclusively serve designated
or specified public transportation vehicles. All other types of loading
zones for passengers must meet criteria for passenger loading zones
(§503). Where regular passenger loading zones are designed to serve
buses in addition to other types of vehicles not used to provide public
transportation, they remain subject to criteria in §503, although
applying the requirements for bus loading zones in §810.2 as well is
advisable, but not required.

*Is a compliant passenger loading zone required where valet parking is
provided?*

An accessible passenger loading zone is required where parking
facilities provide valet parking services (§F209.4). Also, an accessible
passenger loading zone is required where passenger loading zones are
provided and specifically designed or designated, such as many hotel
entrances, whether or not valet parking service is provided (§F209.2.1).
If a site provides valet parking service but contains no parking
facilities (i.e., vehicles are parked on a different site), then a
compliant passenger loading zone is required only where a passenger
loading zone is provided. Here are several examples of how these
requirements apply:

-   if a parking garage (or other parking facility) provides valet
    parking service, an accessible passenger loading zone is required
    whether or not a passenger loading zone is planned;
-   if a restaurant or hotel provides a designed or designated passenger
    loading zone, an accessible passenger loading zone is required
    whether or not valet parking service is provided;
-   if a restaurant or hotel provides valet parking service but does not
    have a parking facility on the same site (i.e., vehicles are parked
    off site in a public garage or on public streets) and does not have
    a designed or designated passenger loading zone, then a compliant
    passenger loading zone is not required. (Note that policies and
    practices may need to be modified so that the valet parking service
    accommodates people with disabilities).

*Must the access aisle be flush with the pull-up space?*

Yes, the access aisle at accessible passenger loading zones must be at
the same level as the vehicle pull-up space it serves.

*Can curb ramps overlap access aisles?*

No, access aisles, as well as vehicle pull-up spaces, cannot have
changes in level other than slopes not exceeding 1:48.

*How are accessible passenger loading zone aisles to be marked?*

The Standards require access aisles to be marked so as to discourage
parking in them, but they do not specify how markings are to be
provided. State or local codes and regulations may specify such
markings. Vehicle pull-up spaces are not required to be marked.

*Are accessible passenger loading zones required to be labeled by the
International Symbol of Accessibility?*

No, accessible passenger loading zones are not required to be identified
by the International Symbol of Accessibility.

### []{#number}Required Compliance \[[§F210](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F210%20Stairways)\]

Interior and exterior stairs that are part of a required means of egress
must meet the Standards.  Compliance is required for all stairs on
required egress routes, including those comprised of a single riser.
 The Standards do not apply to stairways that are not part of a required
means of egress nor to alternating tread devices and "ship's ladders."
 The Standards exempt aisle stairs in assembly areas, stairs in
non-public areas of detention and correctional facilities, and stairs of
play components.

![Building schematic showing monumental stairs between two floors and
stair towers on each end connecting all 3 floors. Notes: Stairs that are
part of a required means of egress must comply. Compliance is not
required for monumental stairs and other stairs if they are not part of
a required means of egress. Second figure shows exit door to exterior
landing with stairs. Note: Stairs that are part of exit discharge or
other components of a means of egress must comply.

**Alterations**

In alterations, stairs between levels that are connected by an
accessible route (e.g., ramp or elevator) are not required to meet the
Standards, but handrails must comply when stairs that are part of a
means of egress are altered (§F210.1, Ex. 2).

###  []{#stairs}Stairways \[[§504](../aba-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#504%20Stairways)\]

Requirements for stairways address treads and risers, surfaces, nosings,
and handrails.

![Stairs with riser 4" -- 7" high and tread depth 11" min. Notes: Treads
and Risers (§504.2 and §504.3) All steps on a flight must have uniform
riser heights within a range of 4" -- 7" and uniform tread depths that
are 11" min. Open risers are prohibited. Tread Surface and Wet
Conditions (§504.4 and (§504.7) Tread surfaces must comply with
requirements for ground and floor surfaces (§302) and cannot have
changes in level other than slopes not steeper than 1:48. Treads and
landings subject to wet conditions must be designed to prevent the
accumulation of
water.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter5/5s3.jpg){width="550"

![Three nosing profiles shown. Tread edge radius with note: The radius
of curvature at the leading edge of the tread must be ½" max. Angled
riser with note: Risers can slope under the tread at an angle not
exceeding 30º from vertical. Curved or beveled nosing with note: Nosings
cannot project more than 1½" over the tread, and the underside of the
leading edge of the nosing must be curved or beveled.

### []{#hrails}Handrails \[[§504.6](../aba-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#504%20Stairways), [§505](../aba-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#505%20Handrails)\]

Handrails are required on both sides of stairs and must be continuous
within the full length of each stair flight.  Inside handrails on
switchback or dogleg stairs must be continuous.

**Stairway Handrails**

![Switchback stair and landing. Notes and labels: 12" min. horizontal
top extension in same direction as stair flight (§505.10.2); 34" - 38"

Sloped bottom extension 1 tread depth min. beyond last riser nosing in
same direction as stair flight (§505.10.3), Handrails must return to a
wall, guard, or floor and cannot rotate within fittings (§505.10.2,
§505.10.3), Inside handrails at switchback/ dogleg turns must be
continuous (extension not required) (§505.3), Top and sides of gripping
surface cannot be obstructed; bottom can be obstructed up to 20% of the
length (§505.6), In alterations, full handrail extensions are not
required where they would project into circulation paths and pose a
hazard (§505.10, Ex.
3).](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter5/5s5.jpg){width="600"

  **![design compass](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/compass.jpg){width="35" height="63"}*Recommendation:*  In facilities that primarily serve children, a second set of stairway handrails 28" high maximum above stair nosings is advisable. A vertical clearance 9" minimum between upper and lower handrails will help prevent entrapment.

**Handrail Extensions
\[[§505.10](../aba-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#505%20Handrails)\]**

Handrail extensions at the top and bottom must return to walls, guards,
or floors and horizontal portions must comply as protruding objects. The
length is measured to the start of the return radius.

* ![Top horizontal handrail extension 12" long min. at stairs. Note:
Handrails at the top of stairways must extend 12" minimum horizontally
above the landing beginning directly above the first riser nosing or be
continuous to the handrail of an adjacent stair flight (§505.10.2).

27" cannot protrude into circulation paths more than 12" (§307.3). With
handrails, this applies only to horizontal portions, not sloped
portions. Horizontal top extensions that return to posts can protrude
any amount if the leading edge is 27" max. above the finish floor or
ground. Recommendation: Treat free-standing bottom extensions as
protruding objects if they have leading edges higher than
27".](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter5/5s8a.jpg){width="524"

**Handrail Clearance and Cross Section
\[[§505.5](../aba-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#505%20Handrails),
[§505.7](../aba-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#505%20Handrails)\]**

Surface requirements and clearances facilitate a power grip along the
length of handrails.  Handrails can have circular or non-circular
cross-sections, but must have rounded edges.  The gripping surface and
adjacent surfaces must be free of abrasive or sharp elements.
 Wall-mounted handrails with leading edges higher than 27" cannot
protrude more than 4½" into circulation paths (§307.2).

**Circular Cross Section and Clearance**

**![Handrail circular cross section 1/1/4" to 2" in diameter with a 1 ½"
clearance behind and below. Note: Specifications for handrails also
address the diameter of circular cross sections and required knuckle
clearance.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter4/4ar29.jpg){width="500"

2 ¼" max. dimension, rounded edges, 4" to 6 ¼" perimeter dimension, 1 ½"
clearance behind, and clearance below that is 1 ½" (less 1/8" for each
½" additional perimeter dimension. Note: Non-circular cross sections
must have rounded edges and meet perimeter and cross-section dimensions.

height="78"}The ABA Standards address escalators in rail and fixed
guideway stations (§810.9) but not those provided in other types of
facilities.  Escalators must have a clear width of at least 32" and meet
specific provisions in the ASME A17.1 Safety Code for Elevators and
Escalators.  The referenced ASME criteria require steps to be demarcated
by yellow lines 2" wide maximum along the back and sides (§6.1.3.5.6)
and specify at least 2, but no more than 4, flat steps at escalator
entrances and exits (§6.1.3.6.5).

###  []{#cq}Common Questions {#common-questions-11 style="text-align: left;"}

 

*Are stairs that are not part of means of egress required to comply with
the Standards?*

No, stairs that are not part of a required means of egress do not have
to meet the Standards.

*Are exterior stairs required to comply with the Standards?*

The Standards apply to both exterior and interior stairs that are part
of a required means of egress. This includes exterior stairs that are
part of exit discharge (i.e., the path from an exit to a public way such
as a street or alley).

*Is there a minimum number of risers a stairway must have for it to be
covered?*

No, the Standards apply to any stairs that are part of a means of egress
regardless of the number of risers.

*Are stairs in residential dwelling units covered by the Standards
required to comply?*

Yes, stairs that are part of a means of egress must comply in mobility
accessible residential dwelling units covered by the Standards. Egress
stairs of residential facilities that are located outside individual
dwelling units also must comply.

*Can stair treads and risers be perforated?*

Stair treads must meet requirements for floor or ground surfaces which
specify that surface openings not allow passage of a sphere more than ½
inch in diameter (§302.3). Risers cannot be open, but perforations or
openings in riser surfaces that prohibit passage of a sphere not more
than ½ inch in diameter are acceptable.

*Can handrail extensions wrap or turn?*

Handrail extensions must be in the same direction as the stair flight,
but continuous handrails can wrap at the inside turn of switchback or
dogleg stairways. In alterations where the required extension would
project into circulation paths and pose a hazard, they can turn, wrap,
or be shortened as necessary.

*![Handrail extension shown at latch side of door and shown outside door
maneuvering clearance that is located 8" max. from the face of the
door.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter5/5s10.jpg){width="240"
height="226"}Can handrails overlap door maneuvering clearances?*

No, door maneuvering clearances must be free of any overlapping objects,
even those providing knee and toe clearance, which can interfere with
maneuvering at doors and doorways. However, door maneuvering clearances
can be offset up to 8" from the face of the door or gate to accommodate
wall thickness, casework, shelves, or other elements adjacent to
doorways, including handrails. The door maneuvering clearance must be
measured from the leading edge of such elements so that the full
clearance is free of any obstruction.

*Can handrails be attached to guard rails?*

Yes, handrails can be installed on guard rails if all applicable
requirements are met.

*Is a center handrail required at wide stairways?*

No, a center handrail at stairs is not required by the Standards. If a
center handrail is provided, compliance with the handrail
specifications, while advisable, is not required.

*Is color contrast required for stair nosings?*

Visual contrast on stair nosings or the leading edges of treads is
helpful for people with low vision, but it is not required by the
Standards except at escalators in rail and fixed guideway stations which
must meet the ASME A17.1 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators. The
ASME A17.1 code requires escalator steps to be demarcated by yellow
lines 2" wide maximum along the back and sides.

*Can guards or collars be attached to handrails to prevent skateboard
traffic?*

No, handrail gripping surfaces at egress stairs subject to the Standards
must be unobstructed on the top and sides and free of sharp or abrasive
elements so that users can maintain a continuous grip along the full
length (§505.6 and §505.8).
