[]{#intro}This guide provides an introduction to the scoping
requirements of the [ABA Standards](../aba-standards.html) and is
intended to be used with a complete copy of the ABA Standards since it
does not contain or address the full content of the Standards. It is
important that users familiarize themselves with the specific scoping
requirements contained in the ABA Standards.

### **![Diagram -- circle labeled "Chapter 2" pointing circles representing Chapters 3 - 10](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-aba/nc2.jpg){width="200" height="198"}Scoping Requirements**

Requirements in Chapter F2 indicate which elements and spaces must be
accessible on a site or in a facility (the scope of coverage). These
"scoping" requirements apply technical provisions in Chapters 3 -- 10 to
those covered elements and spaces provided on a site.

Applicable building codes, design practices, and other factors determine
the elements and spaces required for a site, including parking, means of
egress, and plumbing fixtures. The ABA Standards, on the other hand,
specify the elements and spaces provided that must be accessible.

 

### []{#f201}Application \[[§F201](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F201%20Application)\]

The ABA Standards apply to the various types of federally funded
facilities subject to the ABA, from simple structures to complex,
multi-facility sites. Requirements in the standards apply to both
exterior and interior spaces and elements provided on a site, usually
without distinction. Provisions for parking, for example, apply equally
to exterior lots and to parking garages. The standards cover permanent
facilities and temporary facilities (other than those used in
construction), such as reviewing stands, stages, portable toilets, and
temporary classrooms.

In new construction, all areas must be fully accessible, including
multiple spaces of the same type, unless otherwise specified. Areas not
required to be fully accessible include:

-   certain limited-use or raised spaces that are exempt (§F203)
-   spaces covered by scoping provisions that require only a specified
    portion of the total number to comply, such as dressing rooms and
    patient bedrooms (various provisions in Chapter 2)

 

### []{#f203}General Exceptions \[[§F203](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F203%20General%20Exceptions)\]

These structures and spaces are fully exempt from the standards and are
not required to be accessible or on an accessible route:

(UFAS)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter2-aba/nc3.jpg){width="60"
height="72"} 
:::

**Existing Elements (§F203.2)**\
In existing facilities, alterations, additions, or leasing actions may
require retrofit of existing elements. Existing elements that meet an
earlier ABA standard, such as the [Uniform Federal Accessibility
Standards](../ufas.html), do not have to be retrofitted to meet the
current standards unless they are altered. \
*Examples: Existing restrooms, drinking fountains, and telephones in
additions or that are part of an accessible path of travel to altered
primary function areas do not have to be upgraded to meet the current
standards if they comply with a previous ABA standard*\

### ![question mark](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/ques.jpg){width="100" height="100"}

### []{#questions}Common Questions

*Are all public use and common use areas required to be accessible?*

All areas of facilities are required to be fully accessible in new
construction except those that are specifically exempt (e.g., certain
types of limited use or raised spaces) or that are covered by provisions
that require only a specified portion to comply (e.g., transient lodging
guest rooms and patient bedrooms). All other rooms and spaces, including
multiple ones of the same type, such as patient exam rooms, classrooms,
and courtrooms, are required to be accessible.

*Are employee work areas required to be accessible?*

Yes, the ABA Standards apply fully to employee work areas (unlike the
ADA standards which have more limited requirements for such spaces).
Elements used by employees in work areas, including work surfaces, must
comply. Spaces used by employees for purposes other than work, including
restrooms, break rooms, locker rooms, lounges, and parking are also
fully covered.

*Can access be provided after construction based on need?*

Access required by the ABA Standards must be put in place and ready for
use as part of construction. This is required in all but a few specified
instances, such as:

-   Toilet and bathrooms in residential dwelling units or accessed
    through an individual's private office for his or her exclusive use
    are not required to be built with certain specifically enumerated
    access features, such as grab bars and lavatory clearances, if they
    are built according to criteria that will facilitate later
    installation or adaptation, such as reinforcement for grab bars and
    removable vanity cabinets.
-   Vertical access to work stations in courtrooms, such as judges'
    benches, can be provided after construction if space and other
    requirements are met to ease later installation of necessary ramps
    or lifts.
