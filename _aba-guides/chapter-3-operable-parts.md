This guide explains requirements in the [ABA
Standards](../aba-standards.html) for operable parts.

### []{#a}Operable Parts Covered \[[§F205](../aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#F205%20Operable%20Parts)\]

Compliance is required for operable parts located in accessible spaces
and along accessible routes. Operable parts include light switches,
electrical and communication receptacles, thermostats, alarm pulls,
automatic door controls, and other elements used by facility occupants.

**Examples of Operable Parts**

![Examples of operable parts (fire extinguisher cabinet, drinking
fountain, fire alarm pull, and electrical outlet. Notes: Compliance is
required for the operable portions of fixed elements, such as cabinet
hardware, but not for inoperable portions or to non-fixed components,
such as fire extinguishers; Electrical outlets, alarm pulls, and many
other types of receptacles and controls are covered; Provisions for
drinking fountains and other elements covered by the standards also
apply the criteria for operable parts; Exempt: floor receptacles and
operable parts used only by service or maintenance
personnel.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3op2-text.jpg){width="550"
height="529"} 

**Examples of Operable Parts in Kitchens**

**![Examples of operable parts in kitchens (faucet controls, outlets,
appliance controls, and cabinet handles). Labels and notes: Electrical
outlets, switches, and faucet controls are required to comply; Appliance
controls and handles to accessible storage are also covered as operable
parts; Controls on elements outside reach range, such as range hoods,
require provision of a second control; If redundant controls (other than
light switches) are provided for an element, one control in each space
is not required to comply; Exempt: HVAC diffusers and dedicated
electrical or communication
receptacles.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3op3-text.jpg){width="550"
height="563"}**

###  **[]{#b}Operable Parts \[[§309](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#309%20Operable%20Parts)\]**

Requirements apply generally to all types of operable parts covered.
They are also referenced by technical sections of the standards covering
drinking fountains, faucet and flush controls, ATM and fare machines,
appliances, storage, windows, and door and gate hardware, and other
elements.

**Accessible Features of Operable Parts**

![Person using wheelchair at fire extinguisher cabinet with labels
noting: operable portions meet usability criteria and are within
accessible reach ranges (non-operable portions can be located outside
reach range); clear floor space for approach and positioning; and an
unobstructed side of the clear floor space adjoins a connecting
accessible
route.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3op4-text.jpg){width="550"
height="460"}**Forward and Side Approaches**

At most elements, clear floor space can be positioned for either a
forward approach or a side approach. A forward approach is required at
some elements, such as drinking fountains and lavatories, for easier
access.

**Forward Approach and Reach**

**Forward Reach

](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3op7.jpg){width="350"
height="358"}**

The range for unobstructed reaches (15" -- 48") applies only to those
portions of elements that are operable. Non-operable portions can be
located outside the range.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\
**Obstructed High Reach**

The maximum reach of 48" is reduced to 44" when the depth of reach over
an obstruction exceeds 20." Knee and toe space must extend the full
depth of reach.

**Side Approach and Reach**

height="410"}**Clear Floor Space
\[[§309.2](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#309%20Operable%20Parts)\]**

Clear floor space can be oriented for a side approach instead of a
forward approach at most operable parts. Nominal centering of the space
on operable portions of elements is advisable, but not required (except
at washers and dryers).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\
**Clear Floor Space**

Additional clearance is required if the space is obstructed on three
sides for more than half the depth to allow easier maneuvering into the
space.

height="440"}Side Reach
\[[§308.3](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#308%20Reach%20Ranges)\]**

\
The range for side reach, like forward reach is 15" to 48" if
unobstructed. The maximum reach depth for this range is 10" measured
from the available clear floor space.

 

**![fuel dispenser

height="59"}Fuel Dispensers**\
The operable parts of fuel dispensers located on existing curbs can be
up to 54" high.

 

 

 

 

 

 

\
**Obstructed High Reach**

The maximum high reach is reduced to 46" when the reach over an
obstruction is deeper than 10" (to a maximum of 24"). Obstructions at
side reaches are limited to a height of 34".

**Side Reach Radius**

Elements located in corners can be difficult to reach from a side
approach.

height="335"}**

**Advisory Reach Range for Children** 

The standards include advisory (non-mandatory) reach ranges based on
children's dimensions that can be followed when operable parts are
designed for use by children. This guidance provides reach ranges
recommended according to three age groups.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Operation
\[[§309.4](../aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#309%20Operable%20Parts)\]**

Operable parts must be usable with one hand and not require:

-   tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist, or
-   more than 5 pounds of force (lbf) to operate.

Parts that can be operated without hand or finger dexterity, fine motor
movement, or simultaneous actions provide easier access and accommodate
a broader range of users.

###  []{#c}Common Questions

\
*Are redundant controls for an element required to comply?*

If redundant controls, other than light switches, serve a single
element, one control in each space is not required to comply. If a
redundant control is located in a different space, however, it must
comply. All light switches are required to comply.

*What types of electrical or communication receptacles are exempt
because they serve a "dedicated use"?*

Electrical receptacles serving a dedicated use include those installed
for appliances, including refrigerators, ranges, and dishwashers, and
wall clocks. Floor electrical receptacles are also exempt. Communication
receptacles serving a dedicated use include phone jacks, data ports,
network and audio-visual connections. Electrical receptacles provided
for portable communication devices such as TTYs are not covered by this
exception and must comply.

*Do reach range requirements apply to elements or only to operable parts
of elements?*

Reach range requirements apply to the operable portions of elements,
including handles, controls, switches, buttons, control pads and other
mechanisms that must be activated or manipulated for use. Non-operable
portions of elements do not have to be within accessible reach ranges.

*Must operable parts be usable with a closed fist?*

Closed-fist operation is a good performance test but is not required by
the standards. Many types of operable parts, such as pull handles,
satisfy the requirements even though they may not be operable with a
closed fist.

*Are turn-key locks prohibited by the standards?*

Key locks or key cards are not prohibited by the standards which apply
only to the fixed portions of operable parts. Similarly, items dispensed
by ATMs and fare machines, such as receipts, cash, fare cards, and
vending machine products are not covered by the standards.
