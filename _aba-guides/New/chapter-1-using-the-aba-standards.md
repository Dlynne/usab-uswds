The Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) requires access to facilities that
are designed, built, or altered with federal funds or leased by federal
agencies. Passed in 1968, it is one of the first laws to address access
to the built environment. The law applies to federal buildings,
including post offices, social security offices, federal courthouses and
prisons, and national parks. It also covers non-federal facilities, such
as public housing units and mass transit systems, built or altered with
federal grants or loans. Coverage is limited to those funding programs
that give the federal agency awarding grants or loans the authority to
establish facility standards. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
of 1990 has similar design mandates but applies to facilities in the
private sector and the state/local government sector without regard to
federal funding.

Four agencies establish the ABA Standards according to guidelines issued
by the Access Board: the General Services Administration (GSA), the
Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). The latest
editions of the [ABA Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/) issued by GSA,
DOD, and USPS are substantively the same and replace the earlier
[Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards](../ufas.html). HUD's update of
the standards is still pending. Regulations and directives from these
agencies apply the standards to facilities within their purview.
