			<h2 class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Sub-section-title">Required Compliance [§212, §213.3.4] </h2>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">The Standards cover access to sink and to lavatories, which are sinks used for handwashing in toilet and bathing facilities. At least one lavatory, where provided, must comply in each accessible toilet or bathing room and be located outside a toilet compartment. </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">Where sinks are provided in accessible rooms or spaces, at least 5%, but no less than one, of each type must comply. This provision applies to sinks in breakrooms, kitchens and kitchenettes, classrooms, and other spaces required to be accessible. Mop or service sinks, which are intended to be used for janitorial or maintenance purposes, are exempt. Other types of sinks used only by employees to perform work are not required to comply (§203.9), although compliance is advisable. </p>

			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">Specifications based on children’s dimensions may be followed when lavatories or sinks are designed primarily for use by children ages 12 and younger. Structured as exceptions, these provisions are optional and serve as alternatives to adult-based dimensions. The Standards do not require building elements, including lavatories and sinks, to be designed or constructed for use primarily by children. This determination is left to other building requirements or regulations, good practice, client preference, or other factors. Exceptions are provided based on two age groups: children 6 to 12 years and children 5 years and younger. </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">A parallel approach is permitted to lavatories or sinks used primarily by children 5 and younger (§606.2, Ex. 5). For this age group, the standard fixture height is too low to accommodate a forward approach. </p>

			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">Clear floor space at lavatories and most sinks must provide a forward approach and include knee and toe space clearance. It is advisable, but not required, that the clear floor space be centered under the fixture. The knee and toe space must underlie the bowl, faucet controls, and other operable parts of the fixture with must be 17” to 25” deep. If the clear floor space is obstructed on both sides for more than half the depth, such as with alcoves, additional clearance is required for maneuvering. </p>

Where cabinetry is provided below lavatories, it is advisable that cabinetry be readily removable with finish floor below and finished walls behind it, similar to requirements for lavatories in residential dwelling units.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h2 class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Sub-section-title">Knee and Toe Clearances</h2>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">Knee and toe space must be at least 30” wide and 17” to 25” deep from the leading edge of the clear floor space. These specified clearances allow space for plumbing, enclosures, and supports outside the minimum clearances. No object may protrude into the required clearances other than the dip of the overflow.</p>

			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">Beyond a depth of 8” measured from the leading edge, the 27” minimum high knee clearance can reduce 18” to a height of 9” minimum (toe space) over a 3” span (6:1 slope). When the knee and toe is deeper than 17”, the additional depth must provide full knee clearance at least 27” high.</p>

			<h2 class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Sub-section-title">Knee and Toe Space and Reach Depth  </h2>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">The knee and toe space must be as deep as the required reach to faucet controls, soap dispensers, and other operable parts.  This requirement is necessary because the forward reach for most people typically does not extend beyond the toes. Open space beyond the required toe clearance is permitted.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">What type of sinks are exempt as “service sinks”? </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">As used in the Standards, the term “service sinks” is similar in meaning as “mop sinks” and refers to sinks used for janitorial or maintenance purposes. </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">Are work use sinks required to comply? </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">Sinks and other elements used only by employees for work are not required to comply (§203.9). Examples include sinks in restaurant kitchens and in laboratories not used for instruction. Providing access to work use sinks is advisable. Sinks in public and common use spaces not used solely by employees for work, including classrooms and laboratories used for instruction, must comply. Where multiple sinks are provided, at least 5%, but no less than one, of each type must comply (§212.3). </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">Are laundry room sinks required to comply? </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">Sinks in laundry facilities not used solely by employees for work, such as those provided for use by residents or guests in residential facilities, dormitories, and other transient lodging, must comply. Those located in commercial laundry facilities and used only by employees, as well as mop or service sinks located in laundry rooms, are not required to comply.  </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">Must the clear floor space at lavatories and sinks be centered? </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">No. It is advisable, though not required, that the clear floor space be nominally centered on the fixture. However, the clear floor space must fully underlie the fixture.</p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">When must sinks or lavatories be designed for use by children?  </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">The Standards do not specify where sinks or lavatories must be designed specifically for children. This determination is usually made based on other building codes or regulations, good practice, client preference, or other factors. Instead, the Standards provide exceptions that can be used when the decision is made to design fixtures for use primarily by children ages 12 and younger.  </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">Can pipes, garbage disposals, or other elements protrude into the knee or toe clearance? </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">No. Only the dip of the overflow is permitted within the required knee and toe clearance. </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">Does space beyond the 6” maximum toe space need to be enclosed?</p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">No, it does not need to be enclosed. Open space beyond the 6” maximum toe space is permitted.</p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">How can garbage disposals be accommodated at sinks? </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">One option is to select a sink with a drain located at the rear of the bowl instead of the center. Another option is a two-bowl sink where knee and toe space is provided below only one bowl. </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">Is the exception permitting a side approach to certain kitchen sinks applicable only to those located in kitchens? </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">The exception applies to kitchen sinks (i.e., used for food preparation or cooking) located in break rooms, kitchenettes and kitchens, party rooms, and similar spaces if they do not contain a cooktop or range. Other types of cooking appliances, including microwave ovens, do not impact application of this exception. </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">Can a lavatory be located outside of a toilet room? </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">Yes. The Standards do not prohibit location of lavatories outside toilet rooms where permitted by codes and other regulations. </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">Can a lavatory be provided in a wheelchair accessible toilet compartment? </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">Yes. However, the toilet compartment must meet requirements for toilet rooms, including turning space (§604.8). A second accessible lavatory must be provided outside the compartment (§213.3.4). </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">Are touch-free (motion sensor) faucets required to remain open for at least 10 seconds? </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">No. Manually operated faucet controls that are metered and activate for a set period of time must remain open for at least 10 seconds. Motion-activated faucet controls are not required to remain open for a minimum duration.  </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">Can accessible mirrors be located above lavatories? </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">Yes. Accessible mirrors can be located above lavatories or countertops if the bottom of the reflecting surface is 40” maximum above the finish floor (§603.3). The bottom of the reflecting surface of mirrors not located above lavatories or countertops must be 35” maximum above the finish floor. </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">If a toilet room has a full-length mirror and a mirror above a countertop or lavatory, must both types comply? </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">No. The Standards require only one mirror in a toilet room to comply. If mirrors are provided above lavatories or counters and at other locations in a toilet room, it is advisable, but not required, that one of each type comply. </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">Are lavatories and sinks provided at outdoor locations required to comply with the Standards?</p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">Yes. At both indoor or outdoor locations, lavatories and sinks that serve accessible facilities or spaces, including, but not limited to, fishing piers, recreational boating facilities, and picnic and camping facilities, must comply. </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_common-questions---italic">Are eyewash stations required to be accessible?  </p>
			<p class="ADA-Technical-Guides_Body">Yes. Eye wash stations must comply as operable parts (§309), including requirements for clear floor space and controls that are within accessible reach range and operable without tight grasping, pinching, twisting of the wrist, or more than 5 lbf. Products that are usable while standing and from seated positions, including forward approach access at those with basins or bowls, are recommended for greater usability. </p>
