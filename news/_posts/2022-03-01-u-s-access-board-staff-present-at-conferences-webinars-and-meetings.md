In January, the Board held the virtual public event “Equity in Healthcare for People with Disabilities.” Accessibility Specialist **Bobby Stinnette** moderated the event and Training Coordinator **Bill Botten** and Senior Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Accessibility Specialist **Kathy Eng** presented on the ADA Standards and Section 508, respectively, including the types of medical facilities, spaces, elements, and equipment covered under the ADA and Section 508. A summary of the presentations and access to the recording can be found in the Board’s [January 13 news article](https://www.access-board.gov/news/2022/01/13/u-s-access-board-hosts-virtual-event-on-equity-in-healthcare-for-people-with-disabilities/).

On January 26, **Dave Yanchulis**, Director of Office of Technical and Information Services, gave two presentations. His presentation “Common Sources of Confusion and Inclusive Customer Service” to Accessibility Professionals Association clarified provisions in the ADA Standards that are prone to misinterpretation, including application of the standards in new construction and alterations, work areas, dining surfaces, toilet rooms, and signs. The presentation also reviewed requirements in the ADA Standards for sales and services counters, check-out aisles, self-service shelves, teller and service windows, and food and beverage dispensers to ensure that goods and serves are accessible to all customers. He also presented to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Learning Community, reviewing the ABA and accessibility requirements for federal facilities, including employee workspaces.

Botten and Senior Accessibility Specialist **Tim Creagan** presented “Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards and Section 508 Overview” to the Social Security Administration as part of the agency’s efforts to meet the requirements of [Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/) on February 16. Creagan reviewed Section 508 Standards and [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) Success Criteria. He detailed the connections between Section 508 Standards and WCAG 2.0 and acquisitions to ensure federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, and use accessible information and communication technology. Creagan also discussed the Board’s [ICT Testing Baseline for Web Accessibility](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/) that sets minimum testing criteria and evaluation guidance to determine if web content meets the 508 Standards. Botten provided an overview of the ABA Accessibility Standards that require buildings or facilities that were designed, built, or altered with federal funds or leased by federal agencies to be accessible to persons with disabilities.
