The Administration for Community Living’s National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) is hosting a series of six listening sessions to obtain input from key stakeholders, especially people with disabilities in developing its 2024-2029 Long-Range Plan. The input from these listening sessions will inform NIDILRR’s future funding priorities and strategic direction. 

NIDILRR’s mission is to generate new knowledge and to promote its effective use to (1) improve the abilities of individuals with disabilities to perform activities of their choice in the community, and to (2) expand society’s capacity to provide full opportunities and accommodations for its citizens with disabilities.  

Stakeholders have two ways to provide input for the plan and to ask questions: participating in the virtual listening sessions, or submitting written feedback via email at [NIDILRRfuture@neweditions.net](mailto:NIDILRRfuture@neweditions.net) **by November 21, 2022**.   

Members of the public are invited to participate in one of the virtual sessions listed below via Zoom. Space is limited and [registration](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcO2rqT4rHtee2eJ5qvsWvORXlq9G0Ol-) is required. Please email [events@1sourceevents.com,](mailto:events@1sourceevents.com) if assistance is needed with the registration process.
