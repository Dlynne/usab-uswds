The U.S. Access Board hosted the virtual public event "Equity in Healthcare for People with Disabilities" yesterday. The event featured panel presentations on standards, research, and resources related to healthcare accessibility, including inclusive medical equipment, healthcare facility design, and information technology, and communication devices and systems. Members of the public were able to pose questions to the presenters during the event. 

Access Board Chair **Greg Fehribach** introduced the event and the first set of presentations from Access Board staff. Accessibility Specialist **Bobby Stinnette** provided a brief overview of the medical diagnostic equipment (MDE) Standards and guidance, including technical provisions on support, communication, operable parts, and prescription drug container labels. Training Coordinator **Bill Botten** discussed the types of medical facilities, spaces, and elements covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Senior ICT Accessibility Specialist **Kathy Eng** reviewed information and communication technology (ICT) Standards for accessibility in relation to healthcare electronic content, specifically with software and hardware. 

**Ana Torres-Davis**, Senior Attorney Advisor at National Council on Disability (NCD), provided a report on the status of enforceable standards for accessible medical equipment. Torres-Davis discussed key findings of NCD's recent report that indicate people with disabilities will need to receive satisfactory healthcare services through the availability of height adjustable exam tables, accessible mammography equipment, accessible weight scales and lift equipment to facilitate transfers, among other accessible medical equipment. She closed her presentation with several recommendations in moving forward to address physical barriers in medical facilities that prevent people from receiving equitable health care. 

**Bill Zellmer**, Program Manager of Physical Access and Regulatory Affairs at Sutter Health Care, reviewed inclusive health care design, particularly in the context of accessible healthcare environments. Zellmer provided case studies and examples to illustrate accessible exam chairs, rooms, and patient bedrooms, overhead lifts, and communication services. He also discussed practical solutioning, such as eliminating protruding objects and designating space for movable furniture, to make medical rooms and spaces accessible to people with disabilities.  

**Zainab Alkebsi**, Policy Counsel at National Association of the Deaf (NAD), presented on communication access in healthcare environments. Alkebsi reviewed several auxiliary aids and services that are available, but not always offered or sufficient to people who are deaf, DeafBlind and hard of hearing in healthcare situations. She also noted the technological and logistical problems in the overreliance on VRI and virtual platforms for telehealth. Alkebsi concluded her presentation with a call to action to implement appropriate protocols in consultation with the deaf and hard of hearing community. 

A recording of the session is available on the Board's YouTube Channel. Presentation materials are available in [PPT (16MB)](https://www.access-board.gov/files/presentations/usab-healthcare-equity-presentation-2022-01-12.pptx) or [PDF (5MB)](https://www.access-board.gov/files/presentations/usab-healthcare-equity-presentation-2022-01-12.pdf) formats.

The Board will soon publish a direct final rule related to its accessibility standards for MDE. These standards are currently voluntary and set forth minimum technical criteria for the accessibility of equipment, such as exam tables, weight scales, and imaging equipment. The Board continues to conduct necessary research to determine the appropriate low transfer height so that its direct final rule is up to date with the latest research. 

The Board's rulemaking agenda also includes the publication of the Public Rights-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) in Fall 2022, an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) of self-service transaction machines in Spring 2022, and an update to accessibility guidelines for rail cars, including the goal of a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in 2023.
