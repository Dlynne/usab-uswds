The Administration for Community Living’s National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) seeks comments from stakeholders on its 2024-2028 Long-Range Plan. The input will help inform NIDILRR’s future funding priorities and strategic direction. 

During Fall 2022, NIDILRR hosted a series of six virtual stakeholder listening sessions to provide an overview of the planning process and gather feedback from stakeholders. While these sessions have concluded, NIDILRR invites stakeholders who have not yet provided feedback via a virtual listening session or the email inbox to submit written feedback for NIDILRR’s consideration to [NIDILRRFuture@neweditions.net](mailto:NIDILRRFuture@neweditions.net). Comments are due **by November 21, 2022**.
