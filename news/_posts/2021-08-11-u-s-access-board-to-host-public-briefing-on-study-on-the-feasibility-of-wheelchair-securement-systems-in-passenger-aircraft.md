title: U.S. Access Board to Host Public Briefing on Study on the Feasibility of
  Wheelchair Securement Systems in Passenger Aircraft
date: 2021-08-11
excerpt: The inability to use one’s wheelchair on airplanes makes air travel
  very difficult, if not impossible, for many people with disabilities. It
  requires multiple transfers between boarding chairs and aircraft seats, posing
  injury risks. To address these challenges, the U.S. Access Board commissioned
  a study to assess the feasibility of equipping aircraft with securement
  systems so that passengers can remain in their wheelchairs on flights. The
  U.S. Access Board will host a public briefing on the Transportation Research
  Board (TRB) final report on September 22 from 1:00 – 3:00 pm (ET). The
  briefing will feature a presentation by . . .

The inability to use one’s wheelchair on airplanes makes air travel very difficult, if not impossible, for many people with disabilities. It requires multiple transfers between boarding chairs and aircraft seats, posing injury risks. To address these challenges, the U.S. Access Board commissioned a study to assess the feasibility of equipping aircraft with securement systems so that passengers can remain in their wheelchairs on flights. The Transportation Research Board (TRB), of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, will release its final report on September 20. The U.S. Access Board will host a public briefing on the final report on September 22 from 1:00 – 3:00 pm (ET). The briefing will feature a presentation by the TRB Study Committee Members, including Committee Chair Dr. Alan Jette, on the two-year research study that focused on the design, engineering, and safety requirements for equipping aircraft with securement mechanisms for wheelchairs. The event is free, but registration is required. Members of the public will be able to pose questions during the event.

Direct questions about the public briefing to [events@access-board.gov.](mailto:events@access-board.gov)  Visit [TRB’s website](https://www8.nationalacademies.org/pa/projectview.aspx?key=51840) for further information on the project.  

The briefing will include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. For further information on registration, visit the [Board’s website](https://www.access-board.gov/about/meetings.html) or contact Rose Marie Bunales at [events@access-board.gov.](mailto:events@access-board.gov)
