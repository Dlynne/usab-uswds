The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released a 20-part video series covering a variety of topics on digital access in education, including ways people with disabilities use technology, applicable federal regulations, and identifying and remediating barriers to access. OCR partnered with the ADA National Network to produce the videos for the purposes of providing basic instructions to many different digital accessibility concepts, such as fundamental manual testing techniques, use of color, logical reading order, meaningful video captions, and others. The videos are designed for a wide range of audiences, including school webmasters, parents and students with disabilities, and educational app developers and other IT vendors. 

The videos are available on ADA National Network’s [OCR Video Series page](https://adata.org/ocr-videos). All videos are open-captioned. For questions or comments regarding the video series, contact the Office of Civil Rights at [OCR@ed.gov.](mailto:OCR@ed.gov)
