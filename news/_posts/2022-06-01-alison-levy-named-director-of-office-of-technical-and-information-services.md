Alison Levy has been named the new Director of the Office of Technical and Information Services (OTIS) at the U.S. Access Board. She succeeds Dave Yanchulis who retired in April after 36 years with the Board. In this role, Levy will manage and establish program goals and operations for OTIS, including those related to accessibility guidelines and standards, technical assistance and guidance, training, and research. OTIS is responsible for the development of the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines and Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Standards, standards and guidelines for accessible information and communication technology, and standards for accessible medical diagnostic equipment. 

“I am excited to have Alison join our team of dedicated experts in the accessibility space.” Board Executive Director Sachin Pavithran said. “She will be leading a team of experts that plays a vital role in advancing our accessibility standards and guidelines and advancing equal access for all.” 

Levy most recently served as the Manager of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Disability Resource Center (DRC). The DRC is a centrally funded office that supports internal supervisors and employees in creating an accessible and inclusive workplace through recruitment, hiring, outreach, education, and reasonable accommodations.  

“Accessibility is a human right that ensures we all thrive together in society,” Levy remarked. “I look forward to working at the Access Board in broadening its capacity to better educate and obtain greater access for all.” 

Previously, Levy served at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), providing leadership over the recruitment, hiring, advancement, and retention of individuals with disabilities, including reasonable accommodations. She developed and implemented policies, procedures, and strategic plans, and facilitated programs through a diverse team of more than 50 contacts across USDA’s 34 mission areas, agencies, and staff offices. Her efforts with a team of diversity and inclusion colleagues yielded USDA’s six-level rise in the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey to #2 for Large Federal Agencies in Diversity Support. 

Levy was one of the founding leaders of the Federal Disability Workforce Consortium (FDWC), a volunteer, interagency organization that grew from 20 to more than 900 federal points of contact with monthly webinars, meetings, and collaborations with the Office of Personnel Management, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Department of Labor’s Office of Disability Employment Policy.  

As a person with disabilities, and with over 30 years of experience in the disability profession, Levy has worked toward improving workplace attitudes and accessibility, and in providing equal opportunity in the post-secondary, public, and private sectors.  Levy earned her B.A. in Public Communication from The American University and her Master’s in Special Education from Johns Hopkins University. She is fluent in American Sign Language.
