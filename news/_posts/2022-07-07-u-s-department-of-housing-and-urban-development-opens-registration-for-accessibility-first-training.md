The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing/Equal Opportunity (FHEO) will provide comprehensive virtual training on accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act for residential elements and spaces, including kitchens, bathrooms, routes, public and common-use areas, and structures. FHEO will also provide an overview session on the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act, including a detailed look at the seven technical requirements, and key information and resources needed to successfully understand and comply with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act. Architects, designers, civil engineers, builders and developers, housing program specialists, property managers and owners, and disability advocates are encouraged to attend.

The training series runs from July 26, 2022, to September 27, 2022. The training sessions are free, but registration is required on HUDâ€™s [Accessibility First Training Calendar webpage](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/accessibility_first_training_calendar). Questions and comments may be submitted on the session's registration pages, and each training session will allot time for subject matter experts to answer questions. Attendees can receive a certificate of attendance and/or certificate for passing a quiz for each session.
