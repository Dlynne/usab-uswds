The U.S. Access Board investigated 38 cases under the [Architectural Barriers Act](https://www.access-board.gov/aba/) (ABA) of 1968 that were resolved through corrective action in FY 2021. The ABA requires access to buildings or facilities that were designed, built, or altered with federal dollars or leased by federal agencies. The Board [enforces the ABA](https://www.access-board.gov/enforcement/) through investigating complaints from the public. 

The majority of cases concerned access to U.S. post offices, which is typical of the Board’s yearly caseload. Most of the complaints involved entrance doors, particularly the opening force of manual doors, and customer parking. The U.S. Postal Service completed action to correct accessibility issues at 32 facilities. Other cases involved military facilities (2), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers (2), and facilities leased by the General Services Administration (GSA) for other agencies (2).   

Filing a complaint with the Board can be easily accomplished by completing an [online form](https://www.access-board.gov/enforcement/complaint.html). Complaints should include the name and address of the facility and a brief description of the access barriers or issues. Complaints can be filed anonymously. 

The first step of an investigation is for the Board to conduct a preliminary analysis to determine if the facility at issue is covered by the ABA. If so, the next step is to determine if the facility meets the applicable accessibility standard. If the facility is not subject to the ABA or if it meets the appropriate accessibility standard, the Board will advise the complainant of its findings. Some facilities are not covered by the ABA but by other laws, such as the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/) (ADA), which is enforced by other agencies and the courts. 

If the facility does not meet the applicable accessibility standard, the Board will work with the responsible entities to develop a plan to bring the facility into compliance. Complaints are typically resolved amicably with the responsible agencies or departments. Cases remain open until all necessary corrective action is completed.
