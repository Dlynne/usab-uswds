These Technical Assistant (TA) Documents address design for facilities, spaces, services, and products that ensure people with disabilities are able to access and use them. It is important to use these TA Documents along with complete copies of the ADA and ABA Standards as they explain, but do not contain or reprint, the text of the ADA and ABA Standards.

In these TA Documents, the terms “must” or “required” refer to the applicable ADA, ABA, and Section 508 Standards with which entities must comply. The words “should” or “recommends” refer to additional recommendations and best practices. Recommendations are not legally binding on any regulated entity but are provided as technical assistance to help regulated entities design facilities, spaces, services, and products that are accessible to and usable by people with disabilities.

These TA documents are intended to be used when the existing standards only partially address the needed access to provide the facility, space, service, or product in a manner that makes it “accessible to and usable by a person a disability.” The TA documents show how to apply the existing standards and include non-mandatory recommendations to improve access to the subject facility, space, service, activity, or product. 

The TA documents currently cover EV Charging Stations. Additional subject TA documents will be posted as they become available. Sign up to the Board’s news email list to receive updates on the release of other sections of the TA documents.

This TA documents are in the public domain, and users are free to distribute and share the content or to disseminate copies. Questions or comments on the TA documents should be directed to the Access Board at ta@access-board.gov or (202) 272-0080 (voice/TTY).
