These Technical Assistant (TA) Documents review and explain accessible design for sites, buildings, facilities, spaces, elements, and services to ensure people with disabilities are able to access and use them. It is important to use these TA Documents along with complete copies of the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/) and [Architectural Barriers Act (ABA)](https://www.access-board.gov/aba/) Accessibility Standards since they explain, but do not contain or reprint, the text of the ADA and ABA Standards. 

The TA Documents show how to apply the existing standards and include non-mandatory recommendations and best practices to improve access to a site, building, facility, space, element, or service. In these TA Documents, the terms “must” or “required” refer to the applicable ADA, ABA, and Section 508 Standards with which entities must comply. The words “should” or “recommend(s)” refer to additional recommendations and best practices. Recommendations are not legally binding on any regulated entity but are provided as technical assistance to help regulated entities design sites, buildings, facilities, spaces, elements, and services that are accessible to and usable by people with disabilities.

The TA documents currently cover design recommendations for accessible electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. Additional subject TA Documents will be posted as they become available. Sign up to the [Board’s news email](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USACCESS/subscriber/new?topic_id=USACCESS_1) list to receive updates on the release of other sections of the TA documents.

These TA Documents are in the public domain, and users are free to distribute and share the content or to disseminate copies. Questions or comments on the TA Documents should be directed to the Board at <ta@access-board.gov> or 1-202-272-0080, extension 3 (voice/TTY).
