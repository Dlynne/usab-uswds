Hannah Raissa Ibañez, Esq. currently works as a Senior Staff Attorney on the Tenant Defense Project for Inner City Law Center (ICLC), a non-profit law firm that provides free legal services to vulnerable residents of Los Angeles.  In this role, she provides litigation defense to low-income tenants, working poor families, immigrants, people who are living with HIV/AIDS, people with disabilities, and veterans facing homelessness and eviction.  Prior to joining ICLC, she was an Assistant Public Defender for Florida’s Sixth and Twelfth Judicial Districts, serving in both Misdemeanor and Felony Divisions.  She served on the board for the Red Tent Women’s Initiative, a Florida non-profit that focuses on providing resources to incarcerated women to assist in their transition back into society.  She developed a pro-bono clinic between the Sixth Judicial Circuit Public Defender’s office and her alma mater, Stetson Law school’s Social Justice Advocacy Program, to provide support to Public Defenders and their clients, while giving young lawyers the opportunity to consider a career in social rights advocacy.  She attended Simmons University in Boston, MA for her undergraduate education. Currently, she volunteers with the Los Angeles chapter of the National Lawyers Guild as a Legal Observer, ensuring that the constitutional rights of peaceful organizers are protected.
