## Management Discussion and Analysis

### Mission

Established by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the United States Access Board---which was then known as the "Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board"---is a small, independent federal agency devoted to advancing accessibility and equality for people with disabilities. Originally, in the mid-1970s, the Access Board’s primary mission was enforcement of the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), which requires federal buildings and certain other federally financed facilities to be accessible to persons with disabilities. Congress has, however, expanded the agency’s mission and responsibilities over the years. Today, the Access Board’s mission embraces three main areas: development of accessibility criteria for the built environment and other matters as directed by Congress (e.g., transit vehicles, information and communication technology, telecommunications equipment, medical diagnostic equipment); training and technical assistance; and ABA enforcement.

### Organizational Structure

The Access Board is governed by a 25-member board, with the Board Chair serving as agency head. The figure below depicts the agency's organizational structure in FY 2022.

### Board Members

The agency's 25-member governing Board acts as a coordinating body among senior officials from twelve federal agencies (referred to as "Federal Members") and thirteen presidentially-appointed members of the general public (referred to as "Public Members"), a majority of whom must be persons with disabilities.

Agency heads have the discretion to designate their agencies’ respective Federal Member so long as such members are drawn from the ranks of senior-level appointees (i.e., officials whose positions are compensated on the Executive Schedule at Level IV or higher).  Consequently, the “terms” of Federal Members have no pre-determined length.  Public Members, on the other hand, are appointed for staggered, 4-year terms with the possibility of one successive reappointment term.  Public Members serve as Special Government Employees (SGEs) and, when performing their official duties, are paid at Executive Schedule Level IV. 

Under the Access Board’s Bylaws, the Board generally meets bi-monthly, with one of its Board meetings annually taking place outside the Washington, D.C. area. The Board is led by a Chair and Vice-Chair, each of whom are elected by majority vote of their fellow Board members and serve one-year terms. To foster a balance of interests, the Chair and Vice-Chair must alternate annually between Federal and Public Members, such that, when the Chair is a Federal Member, the Vice-Chair is a Public Member and vice-versa. The Board Chair (or his or her written delegee) act on the agency’s behalf matters reserved for agency heads under federal law or regulation.

### Staff Offices

The Access Board's career staff is organized into four units/offices. At the close of FY 2021, the agency had 28 full-time employees—most of whom are professionals with subject-matter expertise in accessibility matters within the Access Board’s jurisdiction. The agency’s physical office is in Washington, D.C.

#### Office of the Executive Director

The Office of the Executive Director (OED), through the Executive Director, is responsible for providing overall administrative leadership of the agency. The Executive Director, who is appointed by the Board, oversees the day-to-day operation of the agency by, among other things, setting agency-wide priorities and overseeing their performance, supervising agency personnel, ensuring that the budget is administered effectively and efficiently, coordinating Board meetings, and representing the Access Board on inter-agency committees and other official events.

In addition, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 tasks the Executive Director with directing the Access Board’s ABA enforcement program, including, when needed, the issuance of formal citations (which initiate formal administrative proceedings when ABA complaints cannot be resolved voluntarily) and filing of civil actions to enforce final orders.  OED also directs the agency’s public affairs program, including managing its external communications, handling media relations, and serving as point of contact for legislative affairs. 

#### Office of Technical and Information Services

The Office of Technical and Information Services (OTIS) leads the agency’s development of accessibility guidelines and standards for the built environment, transportation vehicles, information and communication technology (ICT), and medical diagnostic equipment. OTIS provides technical assistance and guidance to the public on these guidelines and standards.  It also conducts webinars and training on accessibility and manages some of the Access Board’s communication with the public, such as through the agency’s website.

#### Office of General Counsel

The Office of General Counsel (OGC) provides legal expertise and counsel to Board members and staff regarding the work and operations of the agency, including matters relating to Access Board jurisdiction or authorities and the legal sufficiency of agency regulatory initiatives. OGC also manages the agency’s ethics, Freedom of Information Act, and privacy programs and oversees the Board’s ABA Compliance and Enforcement program.  As the agency’s legal officers, OGC attorneys may represent the agency in administrative proceedings and, where permitted by statute, in civil actions in federal and state courts that arise under the ABA or Section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act.

#### Office of Administration

The Office of Administration (OA) coordinates and manages administrative support activities for the Access Board.  OA’s wide range of support includes the areas of human resources, budget and finance, records management, and information technology (IT) operations and support.  Due to its small size, the Access Board has an inter-agency agreement with the Treasury Department’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service/Administrative Resource Center (BFS/ARC) for financial management, human resources, procurement, and travel services.  OA is responsible for overseeing, and coordinating with, BFS/ARC as our shared services provider.

### Controls, Systems and Legal Compliance

The Access Board recognizes that maintaining integrity and accountability in its financial systems, programs, and operations is critical for good government, demonstrates responsible stewardship over assets and resources, helps ensure high-quality and responsible leadership, allows for effective delivery of services to customers, and maximizes desired program outcomes.

As a small, independent federal agency, Access Board leadership has found that it is both less costly and more effective to obtain various administrative services (e.g., financial management, human resources, procurement, travel, and Equal Employment Opportunity [EEO] services) from federal shared service providers than develop in-house capabilities for these services.  With respect to financial management systems, the Access Board relies heavily on the systems, controls, and assurances provided by BFS/ARC to meet applicable legal requirements, including Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines.  In addition, the Access Board supplements BFS/ARC’s controls with its own internal control processes to ensure the propriety of agency spending, as well as the validity of financial and performance data. Collectively, the Access Board believes that these measures sufficiently ensure that performance and financial data included in this report is accurate, reliable, and complete.
