## Message From the Executive Director

{% asset sachin-portrait.jpg class="img-left shadow radius-lg" alt="Sachin Pavithran photo" %}

I am pleased to present the Performance and Accountability Report (PAR) of the United States Access Board for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021. The report contains our financial and programrnatic performance, insight into our stewardship of taxpayer dollars and the resources entrusted to the agency, and an overview of its FY 2021 efforts to achieve the strategic objectives in the agency's FY 2018-2022 Strategic Plan.

In FY 2021, the Access Board continued its mission to promote accessibility through standards and guidelines, education, enforcement, and outreach. We take stock of the progress we have made and the challenges we have confronted in the past year.

Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Access Board staff have risen to the occasion for  a successful  FY 2021. We  have been working hard with our rulemaking to improve accessibility in various segments of society. We revived the final guidelines for public rights-of-way and shared use paths, began drafting a proposed rule to update its accessibility guidelines for rail vehicles, initiated the process of developing advisory guidelines  for  onboard wheelchaus  used on  commercial passenger  aircraft, and undertook rulemaking that addresses  access  to  self-service  transaction machines. With our  remote training and technical assistance, Access Board staff have provided 85 webinars and virtual trainings to over 23,000 participants, as well as handled assistance to over 4,400 inquirers. We also hosted a four-part senes of virtual meetings, which included over 2,300 total attendees, on making autonomous vehicles accessible to passengers with disabilities. Our ABA enforcement program closed 174 pending complaints, with 38 resulting in removal of accessibility barriers at various federal facilities, from post offices to defense-related and VA facilities.

The Access Board has implemented  strategies  to  raise its public profile by redesigning and updating its website, enhancing its communication efforts, and developing new strategies to engage with the public. In accordance with Executive Orders issued by President Eiden, the Access Board has also begun to enhance its efforts to reach underserved communities by meeting with other federal agencies, presenting to organizations, and developing strategies and actions to better serve those with disabilities m underserved communities.

For FY 2021, I am also pleased to report that the Access Board received an unmodified (clean) audit opinion, which represents more than a decade of  such  opiruons. Brown  & Company,  an independent  public accounting firm, audited the Access Board's FY 2021 consolidated fmancial statements, which are included in this report, and did not identify any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. The  Access Board continues to aspire to be an outstanding steward of taxpayer funds and prioritizes stringent financial management in carrying out its rniss10n.

The following report evinces the outstanding performance of the dedicated efforts of the  Board, its career staff, and its federal partners. In closing the books on FY 2021, the Access Board commits  to  using the lessons from the last year, facing forthcoming challenges, and continuing to strive for excellence in fulfilling our responsibilities to ensure equality and access for people with disabilities.

## Part 1:  Management Discussion and Analysis

### Mission

Established by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the United States Access Board --- which was then known as the "Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board" --- is a small, independent federal agency devoted to advancing accessibility and equality for people with disabilities.  Originally, in the mid-1970s, the Access Board's primary mission was enforcement of the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), which requires federal buildings and certain other federally-financed facilities to be accessible to persons with disabilities.  Congress has, however, expanded the agency's mission and responsibilities over the years.  Today, the Access Board's mission embraces three main areas: development of accessibility criteria for the built environment and other matters as directed by Congress (e.g., transit vehicles, information and communication technology, telecommunications equipment, medical diagnostic equipment); training and technical assistance; and ABA enforcement.

### Organizational Structure

The Access Board is governed by a 25-member board, with the Board Chair serving as agency head.  The figurew below depicts the agency's organizational structure in FY 2021.

### Board Members

The agency's 25-member governing Board acts as a coordinating body among senior officials from twelve federal agencies (referred to as "Federal Members") and thirteen presidentially-appointed members of the general public (referred to as "Public Members"), a majority of whom must be persons with disabilities.

By statute, Federal Members collectively represent ten federal departments (i.e., the Departments of Health and Human Services, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Interior, Defense, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Education, and Commerce), as well as the General Services Administration and the United States Postal Service.  Agency heads have the discretion to designate their agencies' respective Federal Member so long as such members are drawn from the ranks of senior-level appointees (i.e., officials whose positions are compensated on the Executive Scheduled at Level IV or higher).  Consequently, the "terms"of Federal Members have no pre-determined length.

Public Members, on the other hand, are appointed for staggered, 4-year terms with the possibility of one, successive reappointment term.  Public Members serve as Special Government Employees (SGEs) and, when performing their official duties, are paid at Executive Scheduled Level IV.

Under the Access Board's Bylaws, the Board generally meets bi-monthly, with one meeting annually taking place outside the Washington, DC area.  The Board is led by a Chair and Vice-Chair, each of whom are elected by majority vote of their fellow Board members and serve one-year terms.  To foster a balance of interests, the Chair and Vice-Chair must alternate annually between Federal and Public Members, such that, when the Chair is a Federal Member, the Vice-Chair is a Public Member and vice-versa.  The Board Chair (or his or her written delegee) act on the agency's behalf on matters reserved for agency heads under federal law or regulation.

### Staff Offices

The Access Board's career staff is organized into four units/offices.  At the close of FY2020, the agency had 28 full-time employees --- most of whom are professionals with subject-matter expertise in accessibility matters within the Access Board's jurisdiction.  The agency's physical office is located in Washington, DC.

#### Office of the Executive Director

The Office of the Executive Director (OED), through the Executive Director, is responsible for providing overall administrative leadership of the agency.  The Executive Director --- who is appointed by the Board --- oversees the day-to-day operation of the agency, including: setting agency-wide priorities and overseeing their performance, supervising agency personnel; ensuring that the budget is administered effectively and efficiently; coordinating Board meetings; and representing the Access Board on inter-agency committees and at other official events.

In addition, the Rehabilitation Act tasks the Executive Director with directing the Access Board's ABA enforcement program, including --- when needed --- the issuance of formal citations (which initiate formal administrative proceedings when ABA complaints cannot be resolved voluntarily), as well as the filing of civil actions to enforce final orders.

#### Office of Technical and Information Services

The Office of Technical and Information Services (OTIS) leads the agency's development of accessibility guidelines and standards for the built environment, transportation vehicles, information and communications technology, medical diagnostic equipment, and other statutorily-designated areas.  OTIS provides technical assistance and guidance to the public on these guidelines and standards.  It also conducts webinars and training on accessibility and manages the Board's communication with the public, including through the agency's website.

#### Office of General Counsel

The Office of General Counsel (OGC) provides legal advice and counsel to the Board and staff regarding the work and operations of the agency, including matters relating to Access Board jurisdiction or authorities and the legal sufficiency of agency regulatory initiatives.  OGC also manages the agency's ethics, FOIA, and privacy programs and oversees the Board's Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Compliance and Enforcement program.  As the agency's legal officers, OGC attorneys represent the agency in administrative proceedings and, where permitted by statute, civil actions that arise under the ABA or section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act.

#### Office of Administration

The Office of Administration (OA) coordinates and manages administrative support for the Access Board.  OA's wide range of activities include support services related to human resources, budget and finance, records management, and IT networks and systems.  Due to its small size, the Access Board has an inter-agency agreement with the Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service/Administrative Resource Center (BFS/ARC) for financial management, human resources, procurement, and travel services.  OA is responsible for overseeing BFS/ARC's work as our shared services provider.

### Controls, Systems and Legal Compliance

The Access Board recognizes that maintaining integrity and accountability in its financial systems, programs and operations is critical for good government, demonstrates responsible stewardship over assets and resources, helps ensure high-quality and responsible leadership, allows for effective delivery of services to customers and maximizes desired program outcomes.

As a small, independent federal agency, we have found that it is both less costly and more effective to obtain various administrative services (e.g., financial management, human resources, procurement, travel, and EEO services) from federal shared service providers than develop in-house capabilities for these services. With respect to financial management systems, the Access Board relies heavily on the systems, controls, and assurances provided by BFS/ARC to meet applicable legal requirements, including Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines. In addition, we supplement BFS/ARC's controls with our own internal control processes to ensure the propriety of agency spending, as well as the validity of financial and performance data. Taken together, we believe these measures sufficiently ensure that performance and financial data included in this report is accurate, reliable, and complete.

#### Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMIA)

The objective of the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA) is to ensure that agencies have internal controls and financial systems in place that provide reasonable assurance of: the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with regulations and applicable laws. To that end, the FMFIA, as implemented, requires agencies to establish internal control processes consistent with guidelines established by OMB and the Comptroller General. Agency heads must annually attest -- via a written assurance statement -- whether the agency's does/does comply with applicable FMFIA requirements.

During FY 2021, the Access Board had several inter-agency agreements with other federal agencies for shared administrative services. We contracted with BFS/ARC for financial management, human resources, procurement, and travel services. Other shared service providers included the General Services Administration (Internet, voice communication, PIV card administration, and web hosting), USDA's National Financial Center (payroll), DOI's Interior Business Center (HR security and drug testing), and the United States Postal Service (EEO complaint investigation).

With respect to financial management and payroll systems, certain aspects of the Access Board's financial management system are largely influenced by the controls, practices, and procedures employed by BFS/ARC and NFC. Each has established practices and procedures that assure appropriate internal controls. BFS/ARC's financial management system is audited annually for compliance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 18 and we receive quarterly SSAE 18 SOC 1 Type II Reports on the ongoing effectiveness of the system's internal controls. Likewise, NFC annually provides its customers/stakeholders with a written statement of assurance concerning the effectiveness of its financial reporting controls.

Moreover, the Access Board's implemented its own, internal controls and procedures to complement the measures employed by our shared service providers. For example, the Access Board Chief Financial Officer (CFO) reviews and reconciles financial reports from BFS/ARC quarterly to ensure that the agency's obligations and disbursements have been properly recorded; as well, year-end financial statements are reviewed to make sure they are correctly stated. Agency procedure also requires the CFO to prospectively certify funds availability for all obligations. In addition, the CFO and Director of Administration conduct periodic reviews of internal systems, including travel, payroll, and procurement. Lastly, the Access Board's financial statements undergo annual audits by an independent accountant, which include review of the adequacy of our internal control systems.

For these reasons, the Access Board can provide reasonable assurance that internal controls over financial reporting are operating effectively and there are no material weaknesses relating to the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting.

#### Financial Statement Audit

Under the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 (codified at 31 U.S.C. § 3515), most small (i.e., "non-CFO") agencies -- such as the Access Board -- are required to have their financial statements audited annually. Consequently, the Access Board's financial statements have undergone audit annually by independent accountants, including reviews of the adequacy of our control systems.

#### Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA)

In spring 2020, the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) became law. The PPIA repealed the prior statutory regime and established new requirements concerning federal agency obligations to prevent, identify, and annually report on, improper payments (e.g., payment of incorrect amount, duplicate payment). There are, however, some differences. For example, unlike its predecessors, the PPIA establishes a monetary threshold for "significance" determinations, requires agencies to post improper payment reports on their respective websites, tasks OMB with developing PPIA guidance for agencies, and also requires OMB to create a centralized website for agencies' improper payment reports concerning OMB-designated "high-priority" programs.

Because OMB has not yet issued implementing guidance under the PPIA, the contours of agencies' reporting and/or assurance obligations remains unknown. Nonetheless, the Access Board can definitively state that, based on the PPIA's statutory definition of "significance," the agency had no programs/activities at significant risk of improper payments.

Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA)

The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), as amended, maximizes collection of delinquent debts owed to the federal government by facilitating timely action to collect outstanding debts and minimizing collection costs through use of centralized and / or cross-agency collection mechanisms for most non-tax debts. Under the DCLA, federal agencies are required to refer non-tax debts that have been delinquent for more than 120 days to the Treasury Department for collection.

The Access Board pursues the collection of delinquent debt, when it does have DCLA-covered accounts that have been past due for more than 120 days, these debts are referred to the U.S. Treasury for collection.

#### Prompt Payment Act of 1982

The Prompt Payment Act requires federal agencies to make timely payments to vendors for covered supplies and services, pay an interest penalty when payment is made after the due date, and take cash discounts when economically justified. The Access Board always strives to maintain a 100% on-time payment rate and incurred $0 in interest penalties. We will work to maintain 100 % on-time vendor payments in future fiscal years.

#### DATA Act

The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 -- which is commonly referred to as the DATA Act -- requires agencies to establish common standards for financial data provided by all government agencies and to expand the amount of data that agencies must provide to the government website, "USAspending.gov."

The Access Board's shared service provider (BFS/ARC) has implemented software that enables the agency to comply with DATA Act requirements. In FY 2021, we were compliant with applicable DATA Act requirements and timely submitted all certifications.

#### Anti-Deficiency Act

The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal employees from obligating more funds than are available under an appropriation, or before appropriated funds are available, or from volunteering their services to the federal government. The Access Board had no anti-deficiency violations in FY 2021. As required by this Act, the agency would notify appropriate authorities were such a violation to occur.

#### Computer Information and Security Program

The Federal Information Security Act of 2002 (FISMA), as amended by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, requires agencies to ensure adequate security protections for Federal information systems and information. We continue to make improvements to internal controls through policy, procedure provisions, and an emphasis on employee development. As part of this effort, the Access Board achieved its Authority to Operate (ATO) in FY 2021. We employ ongoing maintenance and testing to keep our ATO active, and further implementation measures will be required to meet the new revision 5, which includes additional provisions for privacy.

#### Performance Data Verification

The Access Board requires accurate performance data to assess agency progress towards its strategic goals and make good management and program decision. The performance data reflected in Part Two of this report were compiled throughout the fiscal year during the normal course of agency business. Although the information herein has not been subject to a formal validation process, it has been reviewed for accuracy by agency leadership.

### Limitations on Financial Statements

The principal financial statements have been prepared to report the financial position and results of our operations of the Access Board, pursuant to the requirements of 31 U.S.C. § 3515(b). The statements have been prepared from the books and records of the Access Board in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for federal entities and the formats prescribed by OMB. Reports used to monitor and control budgetary resources are prepared from the same books and records. The financial statements should be read with the realization that they are for a component of the U.S. government, a sovereign entity.

## Performance Report

### Goal #1: Establish state-of-the-art accessibility standards and guidelines

The first strategic goal is supported by four objectives, which are:

- **Objective 1.1:**  Maximize public participation and stakeholder collaboration in the development of standards and guidelines.
- **Objective 1.2:**  Anticipate and respond to emerging barriers to accessibility in a changing environment.
- **Objective 1.3:**  Develop and maintain accessibility standards and guidelines and keep them up to date.
- **Objective 1.4:**  Promote accessibility through coordination with standards and codes organizations and harmonization of accessibility requirements.

#### Background:

The Access Board is responsible for developing and maintaining accessibility criteria for the built environment, transportation vehicles, information and communication technology (ICT) ), medical diagnostic equipment, and outdoor recreational areas under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other laws. In general, the agency has regulatory authority for two different types of accessibility criteria: (1) accessibility "standards," which have force of law upon issuance; and (2) accessibility "guidelines," which only have force of law when formally adopted through regulation by an enforcing entity -- typically, another federal agency. For example, under the ADA, the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Transportation (DOT) are obliged to use our ADA Accessibility Guidelines as the baseline for their implementing regulations respectively addressing public accommodations and transportation vehicles. However, until these departments promulgate final regulations doing so, our ADA Accessibility Guidelines are not legally enforceable. By contrast, under section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (codified at 29 U.S.C. § 794d), the Access Board is charged with issuing technical and performance standards for the accessibility of information and communication technology (ICT) that federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use, and these standards impose enforceable upon promulgation by the Board.

Additionally, Objective 1.4 reflects the agency's long-standing history of working with model code groups and standards development organizations (SDOs) on codes and voluntary consensus standards affecting accessibility. Through service on numerous public-private code and standards committees, technical working groups, and cooperative research panels, Board members and staff are able to bring to bear the Access Board's expertise and perspective to the ongoing process of developing and maintaining accessibility-related model codes and standards. We believe such efforts enhance our credibility as a knowledgeable source of information regarding technical aspects of accessibility. Working cooperatively with codes organizations and SDOs standards, moreover, brings greater likelihood of harmonization between private codes/standards and federal accessibility requirements.

#### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2021:

Under the previous administration, the Access Board was not able to issue proposed or final rules due to constraints on agency rulemaking imposed by Executive Order 13771, Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs (Jan. 2017). This order required federal agencies to rescind two existing regulations as a condition of issuing one new regulation. The Biden Administration revoked this executive order in January 2021, and shortly after the Board resumed work on its rulemaking agenda.

##### Final Accessibility Guidelines for Public Rights-of-Way and Shared Use Paths

The Access Board is working to complete final guidelines for public rights-of-way and shared use paths under the ADA and the Architectural Barriers Act. The Board was poised to finish this rule in the fall of 2016 but suspended action when Executive Order 13771 was issued. During the four years this order was in effect, Access Board staff nonetheless engaged in informal, preparatory efforts, including further review and revision of the text of the final rule, so that the agency would be well-positioned once this regulatory constraint was lifted. In FY 2021, the Board fully resumed work on this rule, including completing its technical and legal review of the text of the final guidelines and proceeding with a regulatory assessment on the final rule. In addition, the Board coordinated this work with DOJ and DOT, which are responsible under the ADA for issuing enforceable standards based on these guidelines. The final regulatory assessment and the final rule are due to be completed by the summer of 2022.

##### Update of Existing ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Rail Vehicles

The Access Board's existing accessibility guidelines for ADA-covered rail vehicles (e.g., rapid, light, commuter, inter-city rail cars) were issued in 1991 and have not been subsequently modified or updated. These guidelines are thus in need of a "refresh" to keep pace with newer technologies and changes in rail vehicle design, and to incorporate more recently developed national or international consensus standards.

In September 2021, the Board began drafting a proposed rule to update its accessibility guidelines for rail vehicles. The rule will be based on recommendations in a report by the Access Board's Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee (RVAAC). The advisory committee, whose members included representatives from advocacy organizations, transit operators, rail car manufacturers, and other stakeholders, reviewed the existing rail car guidelines and identified areas that need to be updated because of accessibility issues, advances in technology, changes in car design, and other factors. Recommendations from the committee address rail car communications, boarding and alighting, on-board circulation, seating, and rooms and spaces.

The proposed rule will also be based on the Board's review of public comments on an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) it published in FY 2020. This notice served several purposes. First, it informed the public that we were considering updates to our existing guidelines. Second, the Board noted its potential reliance on the RVAAC report and sought feedback on this approach, including potential impacts on vehicle design, operations, and costs. Third, the Board sought information on economic data concerning costs and/or benefits of accessible rail vehicles, as well as emerging designs or technologies that improve rail vehicle accessibility. We received over 200 public comments in response to this notice and have evaluated and analyzed them in preparation for preparing the proposed rule.

##### Advisory Guidelines for Onboard Wheelchairs

The Access Board is developing voluntary, advisory guidelines for onboard wheelchairs used on commercial passenger aircraft to aid DOT in its separate rulemaking to improve access to air travel. DOT, as part of a negotiated rulemaking process, is undertaking rulemaking to supplement is regulations issued under the Air Carrier Access Act to improve access to lavatories for passengers with disabilities on single-aisle aircraft with over 125 seats. DOT's proposed rule, which was published in January 2020, included enhanced requirements to improve the safety and usability of onboard wheelchairs which enable passengers with mobility disabilities to access aircraft lavatories. Structured as performance standards, the requirements specify features and capabilities for onboard wheelchairs while allowing manufacturers flexibility in how to achieve them in the design of their products.

At DOT's request, the Access Board drafted voluntary design guidelines for onboard wheelchairs that would assist air carriers and onboard wheelchair manufacturers by providing one example of how to satisfy DOT's performance standards. These non-binding guidelines, which the Board made available for public comment in FY 2019, would be optional; airlines would not be required to follow them and could use alternative designs that meet the level of accessibility specified by DOT's performance standards. The guidelines provide technical specifications (e.g., dimensions, features, and capabilities) for onboard wheelchairs.

In FY 2021, the Access Board proceeded to finalize its guidelines based on its review of public comments on the proposed rule. It also coordinated with DOT on its rulemaking on aircraft lavatories. By the end of FY 2021, the Board and DOT agreed to hold a joint public meeting in December 2021 to collect additional information needed to complete work on DOT's final rule and the Board's onboard wheelchair guidelines.

##### Supplementary Guidelines on Self-Service Transaction Machines

Kiosks and other types of Self-Service Transaction Machines (SSTMs) are now a common feature in places of public accommodation, state and local government facilities (such as motor vehicle departments), and other facilities. They conduct an expanding range of transactions and functions, including use as point-of-sales machines for self-checkout in a growing number of retail facilities, grocery stores, and drug stores. Kiosks at airports and hotels, as well as at doctors' offices, hospitals, and other healthcare providers allow guests or patients to check in, while an increasing number of restaurants are providing touchscreens for customers to place orders and pay their checks.

SSTMs have long posed accessibility barriers to people with disabilities, particularly those who are blind or have low vision. Robust speech output is needed to provide access for users unable to see display screens. It is increasingly common for ICT, including kiosks, to have touchscreens without a physical keypad or other tactile controls. This results in the screen not just being an obstacle for output, but for input as well. It is also important that audible information and messages be displayed visually for users who are deaf or hard of hearing. Further, they must be accessible to people with physical disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs, who have limited dexterity, and are of short stature.

The Access Board in undertaking rulemaking to supplement its ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines to address access to SSTMs. Currently, these guidelines fully cover access to ATMs and fare machines, including speech output, but not to other interactive devices. This rulemaking will address access to other types of SSTMs to ensure they are accessible to people with disabilities, including those of are blind or have low vision. In late FY 2021, the Board began drafting an ANPRM that will solicit comment from the public on the planned approach to this rulemaking.

##### Board and Staff Participation in Development of Voluntary Consensus Standards

Access Board staff also serve on numerous committees, technical working groups, and cooperative research panels to ensure that the agency's technical expertise and perspective are brought to bear on development (or revision) of model codes and standards that affect accessibility in a wide range of settings, including such areas as: the built environment; recreational facilities; websites and web content; public transportation technologies; and traffic control devices.

In FY 2021, staff served on, or worked with, the following model code groups, standard-setting organizations, and research cooperatives, including:

- American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Committee on Sports Equipment, Playing Surfaces, and Facilities;
- International Code Council (ICC) Consensus Committee on Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities (ASC A117);
- National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices;
- National Cooperative Highway Research Panel (sponsored by the Transportation Research Board (TRB));
- National Fire Protection Association (NFPA);
- Transportation Cooperative Research Panel (sponsored by TRB);
- Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America (RESNA) Standards Committee on Cognitive Accessibility (CA);
- TRB Standing Committee on Innovative Public Transportation Services and Technologies;
- RESNA Standards Committee for Assistive Technology for Air Travel (ATAT); and
- World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG).

Access Board managers and staff also participated in several inter-agency committees and working groups that foster cooperation on accessibility-related issues. Among other things, in FY 2021, the Access Board served on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-sponsored Interagency Committee on Standards Policy (ICSP), which provides a forum for coordination of federal standards policies and promotion of standardization activities and reports to the Secretary of Commerce through the NIST Director.

Access Board leadership (generally, the Executive Director) represents the agency on the Disability Policy Interagency Working Group (DPG). Meeting monthly, the DPG serves as a collaborative forum for federal agencies (or components) with similar disability-related missions to share information and best practices and establish new partnerships. In FY 2021, the Access Board Chair was appointed an ex officio member of the National Advisory Committee on Individuals with Disabilities and Disasters (NACIDD). Access Board technical staff also served on, and were actively involved with, the technically oriented Chief Information Officers Council's Accessibility Community of Practice and the Federal Communication Commission's Disability Advisory Committee (as ex officio member).

##### Other Initiatives

In addition to the regulatory initiatives and ongoing standards-development work described above, the Access Board also pursued other projects in FY 2021, to promote accessibility through outreach and research.

In the spring of 2021, the U.S. Access Board, in partnership with other federal agencies, conducted a series of virtual meetings on making autonomous vehicles (AVs) accessible to passengers with disabilities. Self-driving cars, shuttles, and other vehicles stand to revolutionize transportation and have the potential to dramatically expand transit options for people with disabilities. The four-part series provided an open forum where members of the public and stakeholders shared information on designing AVs that are inclusive of everyone, including passengers with mobility, sensory, or cognitive disabilities. Each session featured presentations by invited speakers who shared information and research results on design considerations and accessibility solutions. After the presentations, members of the public had the opportunity to ask questions and to share comments, recommendations, and ideas. More detailed information on this series of meetings is presented below, under Goal #4. The sessions were conducted through a webinar (Zoom) platform and recorded. Recordings are available on the Board's website, along with a summary report on the series. The Board is not undertaking rulemaking on AVs at this time and conducted these sessions solely for the purpose of exchanging facts and information about AV accessibility.

Lastly, the Access Board concluded its efforts on a congressionally mandated research study concerning onboard wheelchair securement systems. In Section 432 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, Congress tasked the Access Board -- in consultation with the Department of Transportation (DOT) and other stakeholders -- with conducting a study assessing the technical feasibility of, and operational issues that would be posed by, passengers who use wheelchairs using their own mobility devices (properly secured) onboard commercial aircraft in lieu of airline-provided fixed seating. Considering the complex aeronautical and engineering issues at play when evaluating the feasibility of in-cabin wheelchair securement systems, the Access Board contracted with the Transportation Research Board (TRB) in early October 2019 to conduct the study. TRB, which is a program unit of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, is highly regarded within the transportation research community for its technical expertise and provision of objective, non-partisan research.

In early 2020, TRB convened a 12-member study committee to carry out the feasibility study, with the committee comprised of experts with a variety of professional disciplines, backgrounds, and interests to ensure a balance of perspectives. From February 2020 through May 2021, the study committee held several meetings, three of which were public sessions during which the committee heard testimony from a wide range of experts and private stakeholders, including: disability advocates; aircraft manufacturers; airline industry groups; wheelchair designers and manufacturers; accessible transportation consultants; academicians; flight attendants; and contract service providers. In addition, both the Access Board and FAA briefed the study committee on study-related issues falling within their respective agency missions.

The Committee then completed its draft final report and, as required by TRB protocols for all consensus studies, submitted the draft to a peer review committee (also comprised of a variety of experts in various applicable disciplines). The peer reviewers provided valuable feedback to the committee, which incorporated that feedback into its final report.

The report, entitled "Technical Feasibility of a Wheelchair Securement Concept for Airline Travel: A Preliminary Assessment," was published in September 2021. The publication was preceded by a closed briefings for Access Board Members and Congress. On September 22, the Board hosted a public briefing on the report's findings by four members of the committee, and the public had an opportunity to ask questions about the report's findings and recommendations. A recording of that public briefing, as well as the final report, can be accessed on the Board's website at: <https://www.access-board.gov/aircraft/>. As noted in the report, the committee did not identify any issues in this preliminary assessment that seem likely to present design and engineering challenges so formidable that they call into question the technical feasibility of an in-cabin wheelchair securement system and the value of exploring the concept further. The report identifies several important airline operational and passenger accommodation issues and recommends further areas that merit further study.
