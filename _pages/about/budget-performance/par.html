<p>I am pleased to present the Performance and Accountability Report (PAR) of the United States Access Board for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021. The report contains our financial and programrnatic performance, insight into our stewardship of taxpayer dollars and the resources entrusted to the agency, and an overview of its FY 2021 efforts to achieve the strategic objectives in the agency's FY 2018-2022 Strategic Plan.</p>
<p>In FY 2021, the Access Board continued its mission to promote accessibility through standards and guidelines, education, enforcement, and outreach. We take stock of the progress we have made and the challenges we have confronted in the past year. </p>
<p> Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Access Board staff have risen to the occasion for  a successful  FY 2021. We  have been working hard with our rulemaking to improve accessibility in various segments of society. We revived the final guidelines for public rights-of-way and shared use paths, began drafting a proposed rule to update its accessibility guidelines for rail vehicles, initiated the process of developing advisory guidelines  for  onboard wheelchaus  used on  commercial passenger  aircraft, and undertook rulemaking that addresses  access  to  self-service  transaction machines. With our  remote training and technical assistance, Access Board staff have provided 85 webinars and virtual trainings to over 23,000 participants, as well as handled assistance to over 4,400 inquirers. We also hosted a four-part senes of virtual meetings, which included over 2,300 total attendees, on making autonomous vehicles accessible to passengers with disabilities. Our ABA enforcement program closed 174 pending complaints, with 38 resulting in removal of accessibility barriers at various federal facilities, from post offices to defense-related and VA facilities. </p>
<p>The Access Board has implemented  strategies  to  raise its public profile by redesigning and updating its website, enhancing its communication efforts, and developing new strategies to engage with the public. In accordance with Executive Orders issued by President Eiden, the Access Board has also begun to enhance its efforts to reach underserved communities by meeting with other federal agencies, presenting to organizations, and developing strategies and actions to better serve those with disabilities m underserved communities. </p>
<p>For FY 2021, I am also pleased to report that the Access Board received an unmodified (clean) audit opinion, which represents more than a decade of  such  opiruons. Brown  &amp; Company,  an independent  public accounting firm, audited the Access Board's FY 2021 consolidated fmancial statements, which are included in this report, and did not identify any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. The  Access Board continues to aspire to be an outstanding steward of taxpayer funds and prioritizes stringent financial management in carrying out its rniss10n. </p>
<p>The following report evinces the outstanding performance of the dedicated efforts of the  Board, its career staff, and its federal partners. In closing the books on FY 2021, the Access Board commits  to  using the lessons from the last year, facing forthcoming challenges, and continuing to strive for excellence in fulfilling our responsibilities to ensure equality and access for people with disabilities.</p>

	<h2>Management Discussion and Analysis</h2>
	<h3>Performance and Accountability Report<br>
October 2021 </h3>
<hr />
	<h2 id="mda">Part 1:&nbsp; Management Discussion and Analysis</h2>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Established by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the United States Access Board &mdash; which was then known as the &ldquo;Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board&rdquo; &mdash; is a small, independent federal agency devoted to advancing accessibility and equality for people with disabilities.&nbsp; Originally, in the mid-1970s, the Access Board&rsquo;s primary mission was enforcement of the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), which requires federal buildings and certain other federally-financed facilities to be accessible to persons with disabilities.&nbsp; Congress has, however, expanded the agency&rsquo;s mission and responsibilities over the years.&nbsp; Today, the Access Board&rsquo;s mission embraces three main areas: development of accessibility criteria for the built environment and other matters as directed by Congress (e.g., transit vehicles, information and communication technology, telecommunications equipment, medical diagnostic equipment); training and technical assistance; and ABA enforcement.</p>
<h3>Organizational Structure</h3>
<p>The Access Board is governed by a 25-member board, with the Board Chair serving as agency head.&nbsp; The figurew below depicts the agency&rsquo;s organizational structure in FY 2021.</p>
<figure> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/usab-org-chart.png"><img width="622" height="359" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/usab-org-chart.png" alt="Organizational structure of Access Board showing Executive Director under Board and three offices under Executive Director: OTIS, OA &amp; OGC."></a>
 <figcaption>Figure 1:&nbsp; U.S. Access Board Organizational Structure</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Board Members</h3>
<p>The agency&rsquo;s 25-member governing Board acts as a coordinating body among senior officials from twelve federal agencies (referred to as &ldquo;Federal Members&rdquo;) and thirteen presidentially-appointed members of the general public (referred to as &ldquo;Public Members&rdquo;), a majority of whom must be persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>By statute, Federal Members collectively represent ten federal departments (i.e., the Departments of Health and Human Services, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Interior, Defense, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Education, and Commerce), as well as the General Services Administration and the United States Postal Service.&nbsp; Agency heads have the discretion to designate their agencies&rsquo; respective Federal Member so long as such members are drawn from the ranks of senior-level appointees (i.e., officials whose positions are compensated on the Executive Scheduled at Level IV or higher).&nbsp; Consequently, the &ldquo;terms&rdquo;of Federal Members have no pre-determined length.</p>
<p>Public Members, on the other hand, are appointed for staggered, 4-year terms with the possibility of one, successive reappointment term.&nbsp; Public Members serve as Special Government Employees (SGEs) and, when performing their official duties, are paid at Executive Scheduled Level IV.</p>
<p>Under the Access Board&rsquo;s Bylaws, the Board generally meets bi-monthly, with one meeting annually taking place outside the Washington, DC area.&nbsp; The Board is led by a Chair and Vice-Chair, each of whom are elected by majority vote of their fellow Board members and serve one-year terms.&nbsp; To foster a balance of interests, the Chair and Vice-Chair must alternate annually between Federal and Public Members, such that, when the Chair is a Federal Member, the Vice-Chair is a Public Member and vice-versa.&nbsp; The Board Chair (or his or her written delegee) act on the agency&rsquo;s behalf on matters reserved for agency heads under federal law or regulation.</p>
<h3>Staff Offices</h3>
<p>The Access Board&rsquo;s career staff is organized into four units/offices.&nbsp; At the close of FY2020, the agency had 28 full-time employees &mdash; most of whom are professionals with subject-matter expertise in accessibility matters within the Access Board&rsquo;s jurisdiction.&nbsp; The agency&rsquo;s physical office is located in Washington, DC.</p>
<h4>Office of the Executive Director</h4>
<p>The Office of the Executive Director (OED), through the Executive Director, is responsible for providing overall administrative leadership of the agency.&nbsp; The Executive Director &mdash; who is appointed by the Board &mdash; oversees the day-to-day operation of the agency, including: setting agency-wide priorities and overseeing their performance, supervising agency personnel; ensuring that the budget is administered effectively and efficiently; coordinating Board meetings; and representing the Access Board on inter-agency committees and at other official events.</p>
<p>In addition, the Rehabilitation Act tasks the Executive Director with directing the Access Board&rsquo;s ABA enforcement program, including &mdash; when needed &mdash; the issuance of formal citations (which initiate formal administrative proceedings when ABA complaints cannot be resolved voluntarily), as well as the filing of civil actions to enforce final orders.</p>
<h4>Office of Technical and Information Services</h4>
<p>The Office of Technical and Information Services (OTIS) leads the agency&rsquo;s development of accessibility guidelines and standards for the built environment, transportation vehicles, information and communications technology, medical diagnostic equipment, and other statutorily-designated areas.&nbsp; OTIS provides technical assistance and guidance to the public on these guidelines and standards.&nbsp; It also conducts webinars and training on accessibility and manages the Board&rsquo;s communication with the public, including through the agency&rsquo;s website.</p>
<h4>Office of General Counsel</h4>
<p>The Office of General Counsel (OGC) provides legal advice and counsel to the Board and staff regarding the work and operations of the agency, including matters relating to Access Board jurisdiction or authorities and the legal sufficiency of agency regulatory initiatives.&nbsp; OGC also manages the agency&rsquo;s ethics, FOIA, and privacy programs and oversees the Board&rsquo;s Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Compliance and Enforcement program.&nbsp; As the agency&rsquo;s legal officers, OGC attorneys represent the agency in administrative proceedings and, where permitted by statute, civil actions that arise under the ABA or section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<h4>Office of Administration</h4>
<p>The Office of Administration (OA) coordinates and manages administrative support for the Access Board.&nbsp; OA&rsquo;s wide range of activities include support services related to human resources, budget and finance, records management, and IT networks and systems.&nbsp; Due to its small size, the Access Board has an inter-agency agreement with the Treasury Department&rsquo;s Bureau of the Fiscal Service/Administrative Resource Center (BFS/ARC) for financial management, human resources, procurement, and travel services.&nbsp; OA is responsible for overseeing BFS/ARC&rsquo;s work as our shared services provider.</p>
<h3 id="_Toc56977628">Performance Highlights</h3>

<h3 id="_Toc56977629">Financial Highlights</h3>
<p>The Access Board&rsquo;s financial statements summarize the financial activity and position of the agency in FY 2020.&nbsp; In Part Three of this report, we provide a complete copy of the final report of the agency&rsquo;s independent auditor for FY 2020, along with its accompanying financial statements, notes on financial statements, and other required supplementary information.&nbsp; Below, we briefly summarize the Access Board&rsquo;s FY 2020 financial statements.</p>
<h4>Balance Sheet</h4>
<h5>Assets</h5>
<p>At the end of Fiscal Year 2020, the Board&rsquo;s assets were $4.1 million, which represents an $0.4 million increase from the end of FY 2019.&nbsp; The Access Board&rsquo;s largest asset &mdash; Fund Balance with Treasury &mdash; increased due to a modest increase in the agency&rsquo;s annual appropriation.</p>
<h5>Liabilities</h5>
<p>The Board&rsquo;s liabilities were $0.9 million as of September 30, 2020.&nbsp; This amount reflects an increase of $0.1 million compared to the end of FY 2019.&nbsp; In FY 2020, Accounts Payable showed an increase due to the timing of invoiced and goods received but not yet invoiced.</p>
<h4>Statement of Net Position</h4>
<p>At the close of Fiscal Year 2020, the Access Board&rsquo;s net position &mdash; which is the difference between total assets and total liabilities &mdash; was $3.2 million. This amount represents an increase of $0.3 million compared to the FY 2019 year-end balance.&nbsp; This increase is primarily due to a change in agency spending patterns this year.</p>
<h4>Statement of Net Cost</h4>
<p>The Statement of Net Cost reports the cost of the agency conducting mission-related work during the reporting period.&nbsp; At the close of FY 2020, the Access Board&rsquo;s net cost was $9 million, which amounts to an increase of $0.7 million increase of relative to the FY 2019 year-end balance.&nbsp; This increase is primarily due to a change in spending patterns arising from the agency&rsquo;s modestly increased annual appropriation for FY 2020.</p>
<h4>Statement of Changes in Net Position</h4>
<p>The Access Board&rsquo;s net position at the close of FY 2020 was $3.2 million &mdash; an increase of $0.3 million compared to FY 2019.&nbsp; This increase is primarily due to a change in FY 2020 spending patterns.</p>
<h4>Statement of Budgetary Resources</h4>
<p>The Statement of Budgetary Resources shows the Access Board&rsquo;s budget authority for FY 2020, along with the status of those resources at the close of the fiscal year.&nbsp; For FY 2020, the Access Board had $9.9 million in total budgetary resources for FY 2020, which was comprised of direct appropriations and unobligated balance available from the prior fiscal year.&nbsp; During this fiscal year, $9 million was obligated for program and administrative functions; $0.8 million was unobligated from prior years.&nbsp; Net outlays in FY 2020 amounted to $7.5 million.&nbsp; The largest contributor to the increase in budgetary resources this year was the agency&rsquo;s modest increase in its annual appropriation.</p>
<h3 id="_Toc56977630">Controls, Systems and Legal Compliance</h3>
<p>The Access Board recognizes that maintaining integrity and accountability in its financial systems, programs and operations is critical for good government by, among other things, demonstrating responsible stewardship over assets and resources, helping ensure high-quality and responsible leadership, allowing for effective delivery of services to customers and maximizing desired program outcomes.</p>
<p>As a small, independent federal agency, we have found that it is both less costly and more effective to obtain various administrative services (e.g., financial management, human resources, procurement, travel, and EEO investigations) from federal shared service providers, as compared to developing these capabilities in-house capabilities.&nbsp; For financial management, the Access Board relies heavily on the systems, controls, and assurances provided by our shared service provider &mdash; BFS/ARC &mdash; to meet applicable legal requirements, including Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines.&nbsp; In addition, we supplement BFS/ARC&rsquo;s controls with our own internal control processes to ensure the propriety of agency spending, as well as the validity of financial and performance data.&nbsp; Taken together, we believe these measures sufficiently ensure that performance and financial data included in this report is accurate, reliable, and complete.</p>
<h4>Federal Managers&rsquo; Financial Integrity Act of 1982</h4>
<p>The objective of the Federal Managers&rsquo; Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA) is to ensure that agencies have internal controls and financial systems in place that provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with regulations and applicable laws.&nbsp; FMFIA, as implemented, requires agencies to establish internal control processes consistent with guidelines established by OMB and the Comptroller General.&nbsp; Agency heads must annually attest &mdash; via written assurance statement &mdash; that the agency&rsquo;s respective internal controls are (or are not) in compliance with applicable FMFIA requirements.</p>
<p>During FY 2020, the Access Board had several inter-agency agreements with other federal agencies for shared administrative services.&nbsp; We contracted with BFS/ARC for financial management, human resources, procurement, and travel services.&nbsp; Other shared service providers included the General Services Administration (Internet, voice communication, PIV card administration, and web hosting), USDA&rsquo;s National Financial Center (payroll), and the United States Postal Service (EEO complaint investigation).</p>
<p>With respect to financial management and payroll systems, certain aspects of the Access Board&rsquo;s financial management system are largely dependent on the controls, practices, and procedures employed by BFS/ARC and NFC.&nbsp; Each of these agencies has established practices and procedures that assure appropriate internal controls.&nbsp; BFS/ARC&rsquo;s financial management system is audited annually for compliance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 18, and we receive quarterly SSAE 18 SOC 1 Type II Reports concerning the ongoing effectiveness of their system&rsquo;s internal controls.&nbsp; Likewise, NFC annually provides its customers/stakeholders with a written statement of assurance regarding the effectiveness of its financial reporting controls.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Access Board&rsquo;s has implemented its own, internal controls and procedures to complement the measures employed by our shared service providers.&nbsp; For example, the Access Board Chief Financial Officer (CFO) reviews and reconciles financial reports from BFS/ARC quarterly to ensure that the agency&rsquo;s obligations and disbursements have been properly recorded; as well, year-end financial statements are reviewed to make sure they are correctly stated.&nbsp; Agency procedure also requires the CFO to prospectively certify funds availability for all obligations.&nbsp; In addition, the CFO and Director of Administration conduct periodic reviews of internal systems, including travel, payroll, and procurement.&nbsp; Lastly, the Access Board&rsquo;s financial statements undergo annual audits by an independent accountant, which include review of the adequacy of our internal control systems.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the Access Board can provide reasonable assurance that internal controls over financial reporting are operating effectively and there are no material weaknesses relating to the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting.</p>
<p>A copy of the Access Board Chair&rsquo;s FY 2020 assurance statement under FMFIA (Section 2) is located below on page 11 of this report.&nbsp; This statement is based on various sources, including: management&rsquo;s knowledge gained from the daily operation of agency programs and reviews; reports and other data provided by the agency&rsquo;s shared service providers (primarily, financial reports from BFS/ARC); and, the independent auditor&rsquo;s final report for FY 2020 and accompanying financial statements.</p>
<h4>Financial Statement Audit</h4>
<p>Under the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 (codified at 31 U.S.C. &sect; 3515), most small federal agencies (i.e., &ldquo;non-CFO&rdquo; agencies) &mdash; including the Access Board &mdash; are required to have their financial statements audited annually.&nbsp; Such audits concern not only agency finances, but also review of the adequacy of control systems.&nbsp; A complete copy of our independent auditor&rsquo;s FY 2020 final report is reproduced in Part Three of this report.</p>
<h4>Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019</h4>
<p>The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) was enacted into law in spring 2020.&nbsp; The PPIA replaced the prior statutory regime concerning federal agency obligations to prevent, identify, and annually report on, improper payments (e.g., payment of incorrect amount, duplicate payment).&nbsp; Departing from its statutory predecessors, the PPIA establishes a monetary threshold for &ldquo;significance&rdquo;determinations, requires agencies to post improper payment reports on their respective websites, tasks OMB with developing PPIA guidance for agencies, and also requires OMB to create a centralized website for agencies&rsquo; improper payment reports concerning OMB-designated &ldquo;high-priority&rdquo; programs.</p>
<p>Because OMB has not yet issued guidance regarding PPIA implementation, the contours of agencies&rsquo; reporting and/or assurance obligations remain unknown.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the Access Board can definitively state that, based on the PPIA&rsquo;s statutory definition of &ldquo;significance,&rdquo;the agency had no programs/activities at significant risk of improper payments in FY 2020.&nbsp; Nor did the agency make any improper payments in FY 2020 &mdash; regardless of &ldquo;significance&rdquo;level &mdash; according to the independent auditor&rsquo;s final report and our own reviews.&nbsp; In making this statement, we have relied on records and performance metrics produced by our financial services provider, BFS/ARC.</p>
<h4>Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996</h4>
<p>The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA) prescribes standards for carrying out federal agency collection actions and referring uncollectible debts to the proper federal agency for collection and litigation. The DCIA has no material effect on our agency because we operate with virtually no delinquent debt. </p>
<p>In 2014, the DCIA was amended by the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) to require that debts outstanding for more than 120 days be transferred to the Treasury Department for collection under the Treasury Offset Program.&nbsp; We currently have one debt being serviced by the Treasury Department.</p>
<h4>Prompt Payment Act of 1982</h4>
<p>The Prompt Payment Act requires federal agencies to make timely payments to vendors for covered supplies and services, pay an interest penalty on tardy payments, and take cash discounts when economically justified.&nbsp; In FY 2020, the Access Board maintained a 100% on-time payment rate and incurred no interest penalties.&nbsp; We will work to maintain 100 % on-time vendor payments in future fiscal years.</p>
<h4>DATA Act</h4>
<p>In addition to revising the requirements for transfer of delinquent debts, the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 &mdash; which is commonly referred to as the DATA Act &mdash; also amended requirements with regard to agencies&rsquo; obligation to post financial data on the government-wide website, &ldquo;USASpending.gov.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Access Board&rsquo;s shared service provider (BFS/ARC) has implemented software that enables us to comply with DATA Act requirements.&nbsp; In FY 2020, we were compliant with applicable DATA Act requirements and timely submitted all certifications.</p>
<h4>Anti-Deficiency Act</h4>
<p>The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal employees from obligating funds than are not available under an existing appropriation and from volunteering their services to the federal government.&nbsp; The Access Board had no anti-deficiency violations in FY 2020.&nbsp; As required by this act, the agency would notify appropriate authorities were such a violation to occur.</p>
<h4>Computer Information and Security Program</h4>
<p>The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 requires agencies to ensure adequate security protections for federal information technology (IT) systems and networks.&nbsp; The Access Board continues to make improvements to internal controls for the agency&rsquo;s IT systems and networks through new or improved agency policies and procedures, along with an emphasis on employee training.&nbsp; As part of this effort, we are working toward the receipt of an &ldquo;Authority to Operate&rdquo;(ATO) under FISMA for our General Support System.&nbsp; We have been working with an external auditor to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls and policies, and compliance with applicable federal authorities in accordance with NIST SP 800-53, <cite>Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations</cite> (Revision 4 Jan. 2014).&nbsp; We anticipate receiving ATO certification for our GSS early in FY 2021.&nbsp; Ongoing maintenance and testing will be required to keep our ATO active.&nbsp; In addition, further implementation measures will be needed to meet the new requirements in newly released NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5, which, among other things, incorporates additional provisions related to information privacy.</p>
<h4>Performance Data Verification</h4>
<p>The Access Board requires accurate performance data to assess agency progress towards its strategic goals and make good management and program decisions.&nbsp; The performance data reflected in Part Two of this report were compiled throughout the fiscal year during the normal course of agency business.&nbsp; Although the information herein has not been subject to a formal validation process, it has been reviewed for accuracy by agency leadership.&nbsp; For example, the performance data concerning technical assistance inquiries (see pages 19-20) comes from information collected on an electronic form this is completed by each accessibility specialist after she or he responds to an inquiry, whether by phone or email.&nbsp; Metrics for the Access Board website (see pages 19-20) are drawn directly from the federal government&rsquo;s Digital Analytics Program (DAP), in which the agency participates, using Google&rsquo;s Analytics360 platform.&nbsp; Lastly, all ABA cases-related data (see pages 21-22) were compiled from the agency&rsquo;s cloud-based Complaint Tracking System (CTS), which is the official repository for all active ABA case records.&nbsp; Enforcement program staff use CTS regularly &mdash; if not daily &mdash; as they process, investigate, monitor, and close ABA complaints.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc56977633">Part Two:&nbsp; Performance Report</h2>
<h3 id="_Toc56977634">Performance Goals, Objectives, and Results</h3>
<p>The Access Board&rsquo;s current strategic plan, which covers FYs 2018 &ndash; 2022, provides the foundation for agency planning and resource allocation.&nbsp; Embracing a vision of &ldquo;advancing accessibility and inclusion for all,&rdquo;this plan establishes four goals, each of which, in turn, is accompanied by two or more objectives.&nbsp; The agency&rsquo;s four strategic goals are:</p>
<ul>
 <li> <strong>Goal 1:</strong>&nbsp; Establish state-of-the-art accessibility standards and guidelines.</li>
 <li> <strong>Goal 2:</strong>&nbsp; Provide training and technical assistance on accessibility.</li>
 <li> <strong>Goal 3:</strong>&nbsp; Increase Architectural Barriers Act awareness and compliance.</li>
 <li> <strong>Goal 4:</strong>&nbsp; Expand awareness of the Access Board&rsquo;s functions and objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>This part highlights some of the Access Board&rsquo;s significant accomplishments in FY 2020.&nbsp; These highlights document our progress toward achievement of these four goals and careful stewardship of federal monies.&nbsp; We trust this performance information will provide the President, Congress, and the public with a better understanding of the agency&rsquo;s work, as we strive to promote a more accessible and inclusive America.</p>
<h4>Goal #1:&nbsp; Establish state-of-the-art accessibility standards and guidelines</h4>
<p>The first strategic goal is supported by four objectives, which are:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Objective 1.1:</strong>&nbsp; Maximize public participation and stakeholder collaboration in the development of standards and guidelines;</li>
 <li><strong>Objective 1.2:</strong>&nbsp; Anticipate and respond to emerging barriers to accessibility in a changing environment;</li>
 <li><strong>Objective 1.3:</strong>&nbsp; Develop and maintain accessibility standards and guidelines and keep them up to date; and</li>
 <li><strong>Objective 1.4:</strong>&nbsp; Promote accessibility through coordination with standards and codes organizations and harmonization of accessibility requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Background:</h5>
<p>With regard to rulemaking, Congress has &mdash; to date &mdash; tasked the Access Board with developing and maintaining accessibility criteria for the built environment, transportation vehicles, information and communication technology (ICT), telecommunications equipment, medical diagnostic equipment, and outdoor recreational areas.&nbsp; In general, the agency has regulatory authority for two different types of accessibility criteria: (1) accessibility &ldquo;standards,&rdquo;which have force of law upon issuance; and (2) accessibility &ldquo;guidelines,&rdquo;which only have force of law when formally adopted through regulation by an enforcing entity &mdash; typically, another federal agency.&nbsp; For example, under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Departments of Justice and Transportation are obliged to use our ADA Accessibility Guidelines as the baseline for their implementing regulations respectively addressing public accommodations and transportation vehicles.&nbsp; However, until these departments promulgate these final regulations, our ADA Accessibility Guidelines are not legally enforceable.&nbsp; By contrast, under section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (codified at 29 U.S.C. &sect; 794d), the Access Board is charged with issuing technical and performance standards for the accessibility of information and communication technology (ICT) that federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use and these standards are enforceable upon promulgation by the Board.</p>
<p>Additionally, Objective 1.4 reflects the agency&rsquo;s long-standing history of working with model code groups and standards development organizations (SDOs) on codes and voluntary consensus standards affecting accessibility.&nbsp; Through service on numerous public-private code and standards committees, technical working groups, and cooperative research panels, Board members and staff are able to bring to bear the Access Board&rsquo;s expertise and perspective to the ongoing process of developing and maintaining accessibility-related model codes and standards.&nbsp; We believe such efforts enhance our credibility as a knowledgeable source of information regarding technical aspects of accessibility.&nbsp; Moreover, working cooperatively with codes organizations and SDOs brings a greater likelihood of harmonization between private codes/standards and federal accessibility requirements.</p>
<h5>Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2020:</h5>
<h6>Update of Existing ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Rail Vehicles</h6>
<p>The Access Board&rsquo;s existing accessibility guidelines for ADA-covered rail vehicles (e.g., subway, commuter rail, inter-city rail vehicles) were issued in 1991 and have not been subsequently modified or updated.&nbsp; These guidelines are thus in need of a &ldquo;refresh&rdquo;to keep pace with newer technologies, changes in rail vehicle design, and incorporate more recently developed national and international consensus standards.</p>
<p>In February 2020, we published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to initiate the regulatory process for potentially updating our accessibility guidelines for rail vehicles. This notice served several purposes.&nbsp; First, this notice informed the public that we were considering updates to our existing guidelines.&nbsp; Secondly, we noted our potential reliance on recommendations from the Access-Board sponsored Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee for proposed, updated accessibility requirements and sought feedback on this approach, including potential impacts on vehicle design, operations, and costs.&nbsp; Lastly, we also sought information on economic data concerning costs and/or benefits of accessible rail vehicles, as well as emerging designs or technologies that improve rail vehicle accessibility.</p>
<p>The public comment period on the Rail Vehicle ANPRM closed in mid-July 2020.&nbsp; We received over 200 public comments in response to this notice.&nbsp; As the fiscal year ends, we are in the process of evaluating and analyzing these comments.&nbsp; We will use information provided by commenters to help frame a future proposed rule.</p>
<h6>Advisory Guidelines for Onboard Wheelchairs</h6>
<p>The Access Board is developing voluntary, advisory guidelines for aircraft onboard wheelchairs (OBWAG) used on commercial passenger aircraft to aid the Department of Transportation (DOT) in the department&rsquo;s separate regulatory initiative to improve access to air travel.&nbsp; DOT, as part of a negotiated rulemaking process, plans to supplement its regulations implementing the Air Carrier Access Act by specifying a performance standard calling for enhanced functionality of onboard wheelchairs relative to current requirements for such devices.&nbsp; (Commercial air carriers are currently required to provide onboard wheelchairs on all aircraft, which facilitate the transfer of passengers with disabilities to in-cabin bathrooms since personal wheelchairs cannot be used on these aircraft.) The Access Board&rsquo;s OBWAG will specify technical specifications (e.g., dimensions, features, and capabilities) for onboard wheelchairs.&nbsp; The Access Board expects its non-binding guidelines to serve as technical assistance for air carriers and manufacturers by providing an illustrative technical approach for onboard wheelchairs which, if followed, would provide assurance of compliance with DOT&rsquo;s forthcoming performance standard for onboard wheelchairs.</p>
<p>In FY 2020, the Access Board continued its efforts &mdash; which began in summer 2019 &mdash; aimed at development and publication of OBWAG.&nbsp; In mid-October 2019, the comment period closed on our &ldquo;notice of invitation&rdquo;for public comment on a draft set of advisory guidelines for onboard wheelchairs.&nbsp; (See 84 Fed. Reg. 43100).&nbsp; In this notice, the Board posed 46 questions about specific provisions in the draft guidelines, while also welcoming input on other aspects of this document.&nbsp; (The Access Board also garnered public input on its draft advisory guidelines by holding a public hearing in mid-September 2019.)</p>
<p>Since the close of public comment on the draft advisory guidelines, our efforts have been mostly &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; to evaluate public comments and better understand relevant technical issues.&nbsp; Access Board staff analyzed the 40 or so comments received in response to our call for public input on the draft OBWAG, with comments having been submitted by individuals, manufacturers, designers, airline associations, academics, and disability rights organizations.&nbsp; Relatedly, following the close of the public comment period in spring 2020 on DOT&rsquo;s proposed rule concerning enhanced requirements for accessible lavatories and onboard wheelchairs on commercial aircraft, we reviewed the nearly 340 comments received by DOT to cull those relating to onboard wheelchairs.&nbsp; We will determine the appropriate next steps for OBWAG finalization after evaluating pertinent comments to DOT&rsquo;s proposed rule (along with those received in response to our prior notice of invitation) and gathering additional technical information, as needed.</p>
<h6>Final Accessibility Guidelines for Public Rights-of-Way and Shared Use Paths</h6>
<p>For over a decade, the Access Board has been working towards issuance of accessibility guidelines for public rights-of-way and shared use paths (SUPs), which we collectively refer to as &ldquo;PROWAG&rdquo;.&nbsp; When the Board issued accessibility guidelines for ABA- and ADA-covered buildings and facilities in 2004, those guidelines deferred establishment of accessibility criteria for facilities and elements unique to public rights-of-way &mdash; such as, on-street parking, intersections, pedestrian signals, crosswalks, and street furniture &mdash; for a separate, future PROWAG-specific rulemaking.</p>
<p>Since then, the Access Board has undertaken various efforts in support of the issuance of a final rule establishing accessibility guidelines for public rights-of-way and shared use paths. Among other things, the agency issued draft accessibility guidelines for public comment (2002 &amp; 2005) and published a notice of proposed rulemaking for Public Rights-of-Way( 2011), an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for shared use paths ( 2011), and a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking combining shared use paths into the public rights-of-way guidelines ( 2013).</p>
<p>In spring 2017, consistent with the deregulatory priorities of the Administration as expressed in Executive Order 13771, <cite>Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs</cite> (Jan. 2017), the PROWAG final rule was designated as a &ldquo;long-term action&rdquo;on the <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaHistory">Spring 2017 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions</a> and, subsequently, dropped from the agency&rsquo;s regulatory agenda.</p>
<p>Although this rulemaking is formally set aside, in FY 2020, agency staff worked with experts at the Transportation Department&rsquo;s Volpe Center to complete work on a contract that expired at the end of the year for preparatory work related to a final regulatory assessment for the PROWAG final rule.&nbsp; The Access Board remains committed to completing work on the PROWAG final rule &mdash; a rule that promises to improve access to streets, sidewalks, and other pedestrian facilities for millions of Americans with disabilities &mdash; when the rulemaking returns to our regulatory agenda.</p>
<h6>Board and Staff Participation in Development of Voluntary Consensus Standards</h6>
<p>Under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), the Access Board has two statutory representatives on both the Election Assistance Commission&rsquo;s 35-member Board of Advisors, which advises the EAC, and the 15-member Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), which assists EAC in the development of voluntary voting system guidelines.&nbsp; These voting system guidelines provide a set of voluntary specifications for voting systems that may be used by states/localities to assess whether their respective voting systems meet basic HAVA-specified standards for system functionality, accessibility, and security.</p>
<p>Two Access Board Public Members have, in recent years, represented the agency on these two EAC bodies.&nbsp; In FY 2020, the Access Board &mdash; through their efforts &mdash; continued to aid in the development of updates to the existing voluntary voting guidelines, a project dubbed &ldquo;VVSG 2.0.&rdquo;&nbsp; In February 2020, after several years&rsquo; work, the TGDC published its &ldquo;Recommendations for Requirements for the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0.&rdquo;&nbsp; In March 2020, EAC opened a 90-day public comment period on the TGDC&rsquo;s requirements recommendations.&nbsp; EAC also held three virtual public hearings to facilitate public understanding and feedback on the TGDC-recommended requirements.&nbsp; The Access Board&rsquo;s two TGDC representatives not only joined these public hearings but also, at the May 2020 hearing, one Board member served as one of the speakers on a panel presentation on &ldquo;Accessibility, Security, and VVSG 2.0.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Access Board staff also serve on numerous committees, technical working groups, and cooperative research panels to ensure that the agency&rsquo;s technical expertise and perspective are brought to bear on development (or revision) of model codes and standards that affect accessibility in a wide range of settings, including such areas as: the built environment; recreational facilities; websites and web content; public transportation technologies; and traffic control devices.</p>
<p>In FY 2020, staff served on, or worked with, the following model code groups, SDOs, and research cooperatives:</p>
<ul>
 <li> American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) A18 Platform Lift and Stairway Chair Lift Committee;</li>
 <li> American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Committee on Sports Equipment, Playing Surfaces, and Facilities;</li>
 <li> International Code Council (ICC) Consensus Committee on Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities (ASC A117);</li>
 <li> National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices;</li>
 <li> National Cooperative Highway Research Panel (sponsored by the Transportation Research Board (TRB:);</li>
 <li> Transportation Cooperative Research Panel (sponsored by TRB);</li>
 <li> Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America (RESNA) Standards Committee on Cognitive Accessibility (CA);</li>
 <li> TRB Standing Committee on Innovative Public Transportation Services and Technologies; </li>
 <li> RESNA Standards Committee for Assistive Technology for Air Travel (ATAT); and</li>
 <li> World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative &ndash; Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG).</li>
</ul>
<p>Access Board managers and staff also participated in several inter-agency committees and working groups that foster inter-agency cooperation on accessibility-related issues.&nbsp; Among other things, in FY 2020, the Access Board Executive Director represented the agency on the National Institute of Standards and Technology-sponsored Interagency Committee on Standards Policy (ICSP).&nbsp; The ICSP provides a forum for coordination of federal standards policies and promotion of standardization activities; this interagency committee reports to the Secretary of Commerce through the NIST Director.&nbsp; Agency leadership (generally, the Executive Director) represents the agency on the Disability Policy Interagency Working Group (DPG).&nbsp; Meeting monthly, the DPG serves as a collaborative forum for agencies (or components) with similar disability-related missions to share information and best practices and establish new partnerships.&nbsp; Access Board technical staff also served on, and were actively involved with, the technically oriented Chief Information Officers Council&rsquo;s Accessibility Community of Practice and the Federal Communication Commission&rsquo;s Disability Advisory Committee (ex officio member).</p>
<h6>Other Initiatives</h6>
<p>In addition to the regulatory initiatives and ongoing standards-development work described above, the Access Board also pursued several other projects in FY 2020, which, though not falling neatly within a particular goal-related category, nonetheless broadly supported the agency&rsquo;s overall mission of advancing accessibility and inclusion for all Americans.&nbsp; Several of these other initiatives are highlighted below.</p>
<p>First, the Access Board provided significant support to the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) &mdash; by way of assistance on technical and cost-benefit matters related to the Access Board&rsquo;s Revised 508 Standards (which were published in January 2017) &mdash; as the council works to update its Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to incorporate these revised standards, as the Rehabilitation Act requires.&nbsp; The FAR Council published a notice of proposed rulemaking in April 2020 and expects to publish a final rule in FY 2021.</p>
<p>Second, Access Board staff are planning a series of (virtual) public forums to promote accessibility in the design of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in partnership with other federal agencies.&nbsp; We anticipate these AV accessibility forums will be held in the first part of FY 2021.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Access Board has continued its efforts on a congressionally-mandated research study concerning onboard wheelchair securement systems.&nbsp; In the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, Congress tasked the Access Board &mdash; in consultation with the Department of Transportation (DOT) and other stakeholders &mdash; with conducting a study assessing the technical feasibility of, and operational issues that would be posed by, passengers who use wheelchairs using their own mobility devices (properly secured) onboard commercial aircraft in lieu of airline-provided fixed seating.&nbsp; The Access Board is required to complete this feasibility study and report to Congress on its results by October 2021 (i.e., one year after commencing study).</p>
<p>Considering the complex aeronautical and engineering issues at play when evaluating the feasibility of in-cabin wheelchair securement systems, the Access Board partnered with the Transportation Research Board (TRB) in early October 2019 to conduct this feasibility study.&nbsp; TRB, which is a program unit of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, is highly regarded within the transportation research community for its technical expertise and provision of objective, non-partisan, research.</p>

<p>In early 2020, TRB convened a 12-member study committee to carry out the feasibility study, with the committee comprised of experts with a variety of professional disciplines, backgrounds, and interests to ensure a balance of perspectives.&nbsp; From February 2020 through the end of the fiscal year, the study committee held six meetings, three of which were public sessions where the committee heard testimony from a wide range of experts and private stakeholders, including: disability advocates; aircraft manufacturers; airline industry groups; wheelchair designers and manufacturers; accessible transportation consultants; academicians; flight attendants and contract service providers.&nbsp; In addition, both the Access Board and FAA have briefed the study committee on study related-issues falling within their respective agency missions.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the study committee&rsquo;s remaining meetings in 2021 will be closed sessions to facilitate committee deliberation and report preparation.&nbsp; Publication of the final report is expected by late September 2021.</p>
<h4>Goal #2:&nbsp; Provide training and technical assistance on accessibility</h4>
<p>Our second strategic goal is supported by three objectives, which are</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Objective 2.1:</strong>&nbsp; Promote and publicize the Board&rsquo;s training and technical assistance services to reach more customers.</li>
 <li><strong>Objective 2.2:</strong>&nbsp; Use multiple communications platforms to reach a broader audience.</li>
 <li><strong>Objective 2.3:</strong>&nbsp; Develop and update educational materials to promote understanding of and compliance with accessibility standards and guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Background:</h5>
<p>The Board promotes accessible design through technical assistance to the public, published guidance, and education and training.&nbsp; We provide technical assistance to the public on our accessibility guidelines and standards, as well as other aspects of accessible design.&nbsp; Over the years, the agency has become known for its free, on-demand, and personalized technical assistance, which is provided through our Office of Technical and Information Services (OTIS).&nbsp; We respond to thousands of technical assistance inquiries each year, which we receive by phone, email, and facsimile.&nbsp; In recent years, our website (www.access-board.gov) has also become a go-to resource.&nbsp; Users of our website can, among other things, view our accessibility guidelines and standards, review an online guide to the ADA standards (which includes downloadable animations illustrating the rationale behind the guidelines and standards showing how accessible features are used by individuals with disabilities), and downloadable versions of our published materials.&nbsp; Collectively, our technical assistance services play a critical role in assisting professionals, governmental jurisdictions, and others understand and apply accessible design requirements.</p>
<h5>Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2020:</h5>
<h6>Agency-Sponsored Trainings</h6>
<p>In FY 2020, the Access Board sponsored or conducted 48 webinars and 22 in-person trainings.&nbsp; Collectively, these trainings had 17,115 participants.&nbsp; Despite the impact of the pandemic, this figure represents a 20% increase in training participants compared to last fiscal last year due to our successful transition to distance learning and remote training.</p>
<p>This year we continued with the two successful webinar series which we have been presenting for the past few years.&nbsp; Both webinar series are provided free of charge and allow participants to join live or view on-demand via archived recordings posted on the web. </p>
<p>The first webinar series addressed accessible design relating to the built environment.&nbsp; Most sessions focused on our ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards and a year-long chapter-by-chapter review of common sources of confusion.&nbsp; These sessions were offered monthly, in cooperation with the National Network of ADA Centers.&nbsp; Continuing education credits (CEUs) were available to participants, if desired.&nbsp; Overall, in FY 2020, over 6,400 people attended the sessions in this webinar series.</p>
<p>The second webinar series &mdash; which addressed Section 508 best practices &mdash; was offered in conjunction with the Chief Information Officers Council Accessibility Community of Practice (CIO ACoP).&nbsp; This series aims to ensure that federal agencies have the knowledge needed to meet their obligations under Section 508 regarding the accessibility of federal websites and other electronic materials.&nbsp; Sessions were offered bi-monthly, with each session running 90 minutes.&nbsp; Topics covered included the accessibility of social media, electronic documents, and virtual meeting platforms, among others.&nbsp; Overall, this this webinar series logged about 3,300 attendees in FY 2020.</p>
<h6>Technical Assistance</h6>
<p>As in prior years, our technical assistance services proved to be one of the agency&rsquo;s signature services.&nbsp; In FY 2020, we handled about 5,300 technical assistance (or &ldquo;TA&rdquo;) inquiries.&nbsp; By type, roughly 56% of these requests were submitted by email, while the remaining 44 % came by phone.&nbsp; (We did not receive any TA inquiries by facsimile.)</p>
<p>Moreover, we experienced no pandemic-related disruption to our technical assistance services, having, earlier in the year, enhanced our TA help line interface to permit remote log-in by accessibility specialists who staff our toll-free TA helpline.&nbsp; At the same time, we also enhanced our helpline phone by expanding its hours (from four to five days per week) and adding a phone feature that allowed callers to leave call-back messages during non-business hours (including weekends and holidays).</p>
<p>This year, we also undertook several projects to improve our technical assistance program, with the crown jewel being the development of a computer-based &ldquo;knowledge management system&rdquo;(KMS).&nbsp; Created in-house, the KMS serves as a central, internal resource for our accessibility specialists when responding to technical assistance requests relating to our guidelines and standards.&nbsp; Information housed in the KMS includes hyper-linked cross-references to agency guidance relevant to a given provision or topic, responses to past TA inquiries, and notations about accessibility or design issues that may warrant future attention by the agency (such as, for example, development of educational materials).&nbsp; We expect this critical tool to pay great dividends by enhancing the clarity and consistency of the technical assistance we provide to the public daily.</p>
<p>At the outset of the fiscal year, we also implemented a process whereby accessibility specialists fielding technical assistance inquiries complete a web-based form after each inquiry that captures essential details, including how submitted (e.g., phone, email), subject matter, and level of complexity.&nbsp; With this TA data, we can more readily conduct program analyses and identify common sources of confusion that could be addressed, for example, in educational materials or webinar sessions.</p>
<p>The Access Board&rsquo;s website also serves a key role in furtherance of our educational mission.&nbsp; Our website houses an array of agency-developed resources and guidance materials.&nbsp; Our popular online &ldquo;Guide to the ADA Standards&rdquo; &mdash; which features animations and technical bulletins that explain and illustrate the requirements in these standards and address common questions &mdash; continues to grow, as we complete work on a chapter-by-chapter basis.&nbsp; Previously, we posted Chapters 1 through 5.&nbsp; This year, we posted bulletins on Chapter 6, which address toilet rooms, bathing facilities, and drinking fountains.&nbsp; Among other things, these three new sections (which collectively total 90 pages) explain relevant provisions in the ADA Standards, answer frequently asked questions, and clarify common sources of confusion.&nbsp; As a testament to the popularity of the technical assistance materials posted on the Access Board website, these pages collectively had slightly more than 2.9 million page views in FY 2020, which represents about 80 % of the total website page views on the Board&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>The Access Board also continued to employ other communication strategies to promote and publicize our technical assistance and training services to a broad audience.&nbsp; We use an email subscription system to promote awareness of the work of the Board.&nbsp; Currently, the Board reaches almost 36,000 subscribers through this system and is able to provide them with Board news, including its bimonthly e-newsletter, &ldquo;Access Currents.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Board also has a Twitter handle (@AccessBoard) with almost 1,800 followers and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5tRWTtV5eSw68N3tSpmyWw">YouTube channel</a> that features videos on the work of the Board and copies of its animations on accessibility.</p>
<h4>Goal #3:&nbsp; Increase Architectural Barriers Act awareness and compliance</h4>
<p>Our third strategic goal is supported by three objectives, which are</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Objective 3.1:</strong>&nbsp; Proactively promote compliance through outreach to federal agencies and design professionals;</li>
 <li><strong>Objective 3.2:</strong>&nbsp; Educate the public about rights under the ABA and the complaint process; and</li>
 <li><strong>Objective 3.3:</strong>&nbsp; Improve the efficiency of the complaint resolution process.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Background:</h5>
<p>The Access Board is the only federal agency designated by Congress to enforce the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA).&nbsp; The ABA requires most buildings designed, constructed, altered, or leased by the federal government &mdash; along with certain other federally-financed facilities &mdash; to be accessible to, and usable by, persons with disabilities.&nbsp; Our ABA enforcement program processes and investigates complaints, and, when violations are found, works with the appropriate federal agency or facility owner/lease holder to remedy these barriers.&nbsp; In any given year, we receive ABA complaints concerning a wide range of federal buildings and facilities, such as office buildings, service centers, post offices, national parks, military facilities, medical centers, and courthouses.</p>
<p>Enforcement program staff also work proactively with federal agencies and others to ensure that relevant officials at headquarters, regional and field offices, and local sites have a working knowledge of their accessibility obligations.&nbsp; We have cultivated productive working relationships with senior leaders at our sister federal agencies, particularly those that own/manage federal properties or see frequent ABA complaints.&nbsp; We also meet regularly (i.e., quarterly or more frequently) with headquarters officials at the General Services Administration to review the status of pending ABA cases and progress on planned remedial measures, as applicable.</p>
<p>Such partnerships with our sister agencies are instrumental in the sustained success of our enforcement program.&nbsp; Indeed, for at least the past decade, we have been able to work cooperatively with federal agencies (or other entities) to remedy accessibility barriers that violate the ABA without having to litigate the matter through formal enforcement proceedings.&nbsp; On occasion, we also succeed in convincing facility owners/lease holders to take corrective action even when the building or facility at issue is not covered by the ABA or, while covered and technically ABA-compliant, nonetheless, consistent with accessibility best practices, warrants modifications.</p>
<h5>Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2020:</h5>
<h6>ABA Cases</h6>
<p>During FY 2020, the Access Board received 140 new ABA complaints and closed 167 pending complaints.&nbsp; The total number of ABA complaints filed this year represented a 17% drop relative to complaints filed in the prior fiscal year (FY 2019).&nbsp; Anecdotally, we believe this decrease in ABA complaint filings is most likely pandemic-related in the sense that, since mid-March 2020, many Americans have been staying home more than they normally would be and, thus, federal facilities, such as post offices and national parks, are being visited less frequently and therefore and less violations are being reported. </p>
<p>Presented below in Table 1 are ABA caseload statistics for FY 2020, as well as comparative data for FYs 2018 and 2019.&nbsp; (<em>Note:</em>&nbsp; All tabular data provided in this section about ABA cases were compiled from the Access Board&rsquo;s cloud-based Complaint Tracking System (CTS), which is the official repository of all ABA complaint files.)</p>
