Members of the U.S. Access Board meet regularly every two months. Board meetings are open to the public. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Board meetings are held virtually.  

The next virtual meeting of the Board on **September 22** will feature a briefing on the results of a Board [study](https://www.access-board.gov/aircraft/) on the feasibility of installing wheelchair securement systems on aircraft. Further details will be posted. 

At its last meeting on July 14, the Board conducted a program on ["Moving Forward: Access to Inclusive Fitness Equipment."](https://www.access-board.gov/news/2021/07/15/u-s-access-board-holds-virtual-meeting-on-inclusive-exercise-and-fitness-equipment/)
