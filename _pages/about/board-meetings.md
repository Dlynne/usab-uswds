Members of the U.S. Access Board meet regularly every two months. Board meetings are open to the public. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Board meetings are held virtually.  

At its last meeting on September 22, the Board held a briefing on the results of a Board-sponsored [Study on the Feasibility of Wheelchair Securement Systems on Aircraft]({{ site.baseurl }}/aircraft/) conducted by the Transportation Research Board (TRB).
