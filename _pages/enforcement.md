The [Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA)](..) stands as the first measure by Congress to ensure access to the built environment for people with disabilities.&nbsp;
The law requires that buildings or facilities that were designed, built, or altered with federal dollars or leased by federal agencies after August 12, 1968 be accessible.&nbsp;
Facilities that predate the law generally are not covered, but alterations or leases undertaken after the law took effect can trigger coverage.

The law covers a wide range of facilities, including U.S. post offices, Veterans Affairs medical facilities, national parks, Social Security Administration offices, federal office buildings, U.S. courthouses, and federal prisons.&nbsp;
It also applies to non-government facilities that have received federal funding, such as certain schools, public housing, and mass transit systems.

If you are concerned about access to a facility that may have been federally funded, you can [file a complaint](/enforcement/complaint.html) about it with the Access Board under the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA).&nbsp;
If you are concerned about other types of accessibility not covered by the ABA, see [Other Resources](https://www.access-board.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=114&Itemid=1157) for more information.

The ABA is enforced through [standards](..) for accessible design, which indicate where access is required and provide detailed specifications for ramps, parking, doors, elevators, restrooms, assistive listening systems, fire alarms, signs, and other accessible building elements.&nbsp;
Facilities covered by the ABA must meet these standards.
