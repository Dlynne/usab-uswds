THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY

The public right-of-way is an ancient concept, as old as the notion of owning land. The commerce of humankind requires circulation, and since the days of the earliest cities, the public street has served as the venue and vessel for the exchange of ideas, opinions, services and goods. For centuries, public rights-of-way ensured the right to passage of all users, humble or grand, on foot or by any other mode.

However, only within the latter half of the last century has serious thought been given to the right to access for those who, historically, had never been considered at all in the built environment. Within the public right-of-way, efforts to accommodate people with disabilities have been accomplished on a state-by-state basis with guidance from various code-writing organizations, but there has been no single national set of guidelines for accommodating people with disabilities in the public right-of-way.

Public rights-of-way harbor many transportation activities, including walking and rolling, bicycling, transit, freight movement, and automobile travel. They house the hardware, such as traffic signals and street lights, that supports those activities. In many cases they contain public and private utilities. With so many diverse functions to be supported, the streetscape within the public right-of-way is often created over a period of time by a variety of minds and hands.

For the individual user the streetscape must work at an intimate level. Details at the individual scale can appear seamless and coherent if they are done right. As David Sucher notes in his book, ***City Comforts***, "An ordinary, even banal structure, can and will be transformed into a marvel if the designer and builder have thought through the users' needs and reflect those needs in the details."

The following report is a recommendation for a new national set of guidelines that define the details necessary to make the streetscapes in public rights-of-way accessible to all users. This report has been prepared by the Public Rights-of-Way Access Advisory Committee (PROWAAC), convened by the U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (the Access Board) to address access to public rights-of-way for people with disabilities.

The members of the PROWAAC represent a broad cross-section of design professionals, transportation industry professionals, implementing agencies, and a diverse range of advocates and users groups. This knowledgeable and representative advisory committee shared a commitment to this fundamental principle: **that all users of all abilities have the right to equal access to public rights-of-way.**

To that end, the PROWAAC developed a toolbox approach to defining standards which will provide that equal access to public rights-of-way. The goal of the toolbox approach is to aid implementing agencies and the designers who work in the public right-of-way to understand the needs of all users and design accordingly. Accessibility is not an afterthought. The design of a coherent corridor of accessible travel should be the starting point for every project in the public right-of-way. If these recommended standards are implemented, then over time public rights-of-way will achieve consistency and equal access for all users.

The guidelines proposed in this report do not call for a minor adjustment here and there, they ask for a dramatic change from the way public rights-of-way have been designed in the past. However, they do not require dramatic changes to streets that were built in the past. It is important to understand that the recommended standards, if adopted, will apply whenever new streets are created and whenever existing streets are reconstructed or otherwise altered in ways that affect their usability by pedestrians. **Implementation of these recommendations will not require jurisdictions to rebuild existing streets solely to meet these standards.**

BACKGROUND

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 is a civil rights statute that prohibits discrimination against people who have disabilities. Under the ADA, designing and constructing facilities for public use that are not usable by people who have disabilities constitutes discrimination.

The ADA covers a wide range of disability, from physical conditions affecting mobility, stamina, sight, hearing, and speech to conditions such as emotional illness and learning disorders. Such disabilities may or may not be evident to others. The percentage of the US population affected by a condition that constitutes a disability under the ADA is expected to increase over the coming decades, in part due to the growing numbers of the elderly.

The ADA addresses access to the workplace (title I), state and local government services (title II), and places of public accommodation and commercial facilities (title III). It also requires telephone companies to provide telecommunications relay services for people who have hearing or speech impairments (title IV) and miscellaneous instructions to Federal agencies that enforce the law (title V).

Public rights-of-way are covered by the ADA under title II, subpart A. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has rulemaking authority and enforcement responsibility for title II, while the Department of Transportation (DOT) has been designated to implement compliance procedures relating to transportation, including those for highways, streets and traffic management. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Office of Civil Rights oversees the DOT mandate in these areas.

The Access Board is an independent Federal agency responsible for developing accessibility guidelines under the ADA to ensure that new construction and alterations covered by titles II and III of the ADA are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The Access Board initially issued the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) in 1991 *(36 CFR 1191, Appendix A)*. ADAAG consists of general sections (ADAAG 1 to 4) that apply to all types of buildings and facilities, and special sections (ADAAG 5 to 12, and 15) that contain additional requirements for certain types of buildings and facilities.

The regulations issued by DOJ and DOT must include accessibility standards for newly constructed and altered facilities covered by title II. The standards must be consistent with the guidelines issued by the Access Board.

#### Rulemaking History

The Access Board published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in December 1992, proposing to add four special application sections to ADAAG applicable to certain types of state and local government buildings and facilities covered by title II of the ADA. One of the proposed sections was 14, Public Rights-of Way. The NPRM also proposed requirements and asked questions regarding the addition of miscellaneous provisions specifically applicable to state and local government facilities.

In June 1994, the Access Board published an interim final rule in the Federal Register that added several sections, including section 14, to ADAAG, along with miscellaneous other provisions. The interim final rule sought comment on the added sections and the miscellaneous provisions.

Many commenters, including public works agencies, transportation departments and traffic consultants, expressed concern that section 14 provisions would require wholesale rebuilding of existing developed rights-of-way. Others were concerned that the section 14 provisions were not reasonable because they did not adequately take into account the way jurisdictions construct and manage facilities in the public right-of-way. In January 1998, the Board published final rules for state and local governments, but decided to reserve section 14, due in large measure to concerns of the transportation community expressed in comments to the Board on the proposed and interim final rules.

The response to both the NPRM and the interim final rule clearly indicated the need for substantial education and outreach regarding the application of guidelines in this area. Rather than finalizing the guidelines for public rights-of-way, the Board embarked upon an ambitious outreach plan to the transportation industry. This outreach included producing a series of videotapes, an accessibility checklist, a synthesis syntheses on accessible pedestrian signals and on detectable warnings installations in the U.S. and abroad, and a design guide on accessible public rights-of-way. In addition, the Board has been actively involved with transportation industry organizations and has closely worked with the Federal Highway Administration on these issues.

In early 1999, the Access Board reviewed its education and outreach program and the impact on state and local government regulatory efforts in this area, and concluded that the development of final requirements for accessibility in the public right-of-way was appropriate. At its May 1999 meeting, the Access Board voted to reinitiate rulemaking on accessible pedestrian facilities in public rights-of-way by convening a Federal advisory committee to develop recommendations for guidelines for public rights-of-way covered by the ADA and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968.

#### Establishing an Advisory Committee

The Public Rights-of-Way Access Advisory Committee (PROWAAC) was established in October 1999 as the first step in developing additional ADAAG provisions and special application sections. A notice of intent to form an advisory committee was published in the *Federal Register* on August 12, 1999. The notice proposed a committee membership and requested applications. Committee members represented the diverse interests of those affected by this rulemaking including persons with disabilities, federal, state, and local public works and transportation agencies, organizations representing design professionals, pedestrian and bicycle organizations, standard-setting organizations, and organizations representing the access needs of individuals with disabilities. The committee worked in a professional and collegial manner to establish this recommendation in a short period of time. The final membership of the committee is listed in Appendix A.

The committee met six times between December 1999 and December 2000 as a full committee. In addition, several subcommittees met physically, by telephone, and by e-mail to gather information or develop recommendations for the full committee. The committee participated in tours and informational presentations as part of their meetings. Committee members sought input from the public on issues related to accessibility of public rights-of-way. The meetings were held in different locations across the country and were attended by more than 100 members of the public. A formal public comment period was held at the end of each day of the full committee meetings. Among the issues that were brought to the attention of the committee were the effects of traffic calming devices, particularly vertical deflection devices such as speed humps, on people who suffer pain; the effects of weed control strategies on people with multiple chemical sensitivities; the need of people with hearing disabilities for accessible communication in the public right-of-way; the need of some blind people for unambiguous information presented in an audible and/or tactile format; and the ability of some blind people to use existing cues to travel independently, without the need for additional information.

The committee began its work by reviewing available information related to providing access for persons with disabilities in public rights-of-way. The committee reviewed the section 14 document included in ADAAG under the Access Board's interim final rule issued in June 1994, the Board's Accessible Rights-of-Way Design Guide, the Federal Highway Administration's Designing Sidewalks and Trails for Access, and other similar information. They also examined and discussed approaches used by states and local governments to meet access responsibilities in the absence of specific ADAAG guidance, and discussed pending design documents such as the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' (AASHTO) *Pedestrian Design Guide*.

#### Basic Principles

The committee's discussions were guided by basic principles. PROWAAC members believed that accessibility standards for pedestrian facilities in public rights-of-way should:

-   Provide for equal opportunity
-   Maximize accessibility for all users
-   Be reasonable
-   Be clear, simple and understandable
-   Be enforceable and measurable
-   Be constructible and maintainable within today's technological capabilities
-   Address safety for both pedestrians and motor vehicle operators
-   Provide guidance for implementing agencies and the public
-   Be flexible enough to include future technologies
-   Be consistent with ADAAG
-   Support independent use by persons with disabilities

The advisory committee explored many approaches and compromised in many areas to reach agreement on recommended accessibility standards for new and altered public rights-of-way covered by the ADA. The standards proposed by the committee and presented in this report include consideration of the latest available information and design and construction practices.

The PROWAAC presents this report to the Access Board at the Transportation Research Board's (TRB) annual meeting in January, 2001. The report addresses the variety of facilities in the public right-of-way and identifies the features of each facility not adequately addressed by ADAAG. This report presents the recommendations of the PROWAAC for accessibility standards for those features.

#### What's next

The Access Board will consider these recommendations and write a proposed rule, which will be published in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). Interested parties will then have a chance to comment on the NPRM before the Department of Justice and/or the Department of Transportation considers whether to issue a final rule.

Some agencies may begin to use the recommendations in this report as guidance even before a final rule is adopted. These recommendations represent the best judgment of the committee on a very large number of issues as developed in a relatively short period of time. However, it should be noted that, inevitably, there are some recommendations in this report, as well as some issues for which recommendations were reserved, where the outcome might have been different had there been more time for the committee to discuss and test what is proposed. The period for public comment will allow these recommended standards to be further refined into a final rule that truly embodies the basic principles that guided the committee.

**The need for larger dimensions in the public right-of-way**\
While fully understanding that the standards must require the minimum dimensions necessary for access, rather than setting desirable or preferred dimensions, PROWAAC members considered the possibility that larger dimensions were necessary in public rights-of-way to provide adequate accessibility.

The committee recognized that maneuvering clearances needed in the public right-of-way may be greater than the clearances needed in a building or facility. Travel in the public right-of-way is generally faster and often may take place under circumstances requiring larger mobility aids. Pedestrians, including persons with disabilities, are much more likely to travel side-by-side or in groups in the public right-of-way. The committee recognized that some people who use crutches require as much as 42 inches (1065mm) of usable width to support travel, and people with service animals or sighted guides will use a minimum of 48 inches (1220mm). The committee also considered that at least 60 inches (1525mm) of width are required for a variety of wheelchairs currently in use to turn or pass; and that 72 inches (1830mm) are required for two wheelchair users to travel side-by-side.

**What to call the "corridor of accessible travel" in the public right-of-way**\
PROWAAC members spent considerable time working to identify a term that would represent an analog in the public right-of-way to the term "accessible route," the basic unit of accessibility for title III entities under ADAAG. This concept was called "continuous passage" in proposed section 14.

The committee discussed the notion of a three-dimensional corridor through which sidewalk travelers could easily move. Designers should understand this as a spatial concept, not just a given expanse of concrete or asphalt. This continuous corridor of accessible travel, threading its way along sidewalks and across driveways and roadways, free of abrupt changes in level, with a clear width of at least sixty inches and a clear height of at least eighty inches, assures access for all sidewalk travelers, from those who use wheelchairs to those who push strollers to those who find their way with a cane.

In searching for the right name for this corridor, the committee took into account the concern that any term very similar to "accessible route," or incorporating the phrase, might lead to confusion. The committee recognized that a corridor in the public right-of-way will have different requirements than the "accessible route" on a site. Creating a distinct name helps avoid any confusion between the requirements proposed for the public right-of-way and those requirements already in existence that apply to a site.

A further concern was to avoid disrespect to any sidewalk travelers. After much debate, the majority of the committee supported the term *pedestrian access route*, and that term is used throughout this report. However, some members felt strongly that the word pedestrian, although defined in this report and commonly used among designers to denote all sidewalk travelers, has its roots in the Latin word for feet, and thus is not the best choice to describe those who use wheelchairs for mobility.

**Wayfinding in public rights-of-way for blind persons or those with low vision**\
PROWAAC members recognized there is a significant need for wayfinding for pedestrians who are blind or have low vision. The committee's recommendations to the Access Board include a number of proposed standards that will, if adopted, provide additional guidance about signs, street crossing controls, pedestrian signals, crossing times and other items. The committee also recognizes that technological changes are occurring rapidly, with the potential to greatly improve access for persons with visual impairments over time. The committee recommends continual review of technology in this area to provide advisory guidance to communities in establishing wayfinding systems.

**Flexibility of the standards with respect to emerging technologies**\
PROWAAC members understood that new technologies are constantly emerging. These recommended standards are intended to be flexible enough to accommodate new technologies, particularly wayfinding technologies, but also new mobility devices, new signal technologies and other technologies that may emerge to increase access and mobility for pedestrians who have disabilities.

**The variety of needs, sometimes competing, of users with diverse disabilities**\
PROWAAC members gave great attention to the needs of all users of public rights-of-way who have disabilities. The committee recognized that efforts to increase access and usability for some pedestrians have caused, or may cause, problems for others with different disabilities. For example, the proliferation of curb ramps in the public rights-of-way has greatly increased access for pedestrians using wheelchairs, scooters and other wheeled mobility aids. However, the curb formerly provided an important cue to blind pedestrians, and where curb ramps are installed that cue has now been lost or diminished. The recommendations for detectable warnings at curb ramps and flush landings are an example of the committee's desire to address these issues.

**Extension of the pedestrian access route into the roadway at crosswalks**\
PROWAAC members recognized that travel by pedestrians with disabilities in public rights-of-way is not limited to sidewalks, and that crosswalks in the roadway are an integral part of the pedestrian access route. The committee worked to develop reasonable standards for crosswalks in new roadways that will foster access for all users.

**The need for pedestrian access on all urban roadways**\
PROWAAC members conceded that the ADA does not require the construction of sidewalks in public rights-of-way, but only requires that, where provided, such facilities meet the standards for accessibility, and that it is not within the purview of this committee to alter the scope of the law. However, in support of the rights of all users, including those who do not use motor vehicles, to access destinations via public rights-of-way, the committee adopted a resolution to express their support for identifying a mechanism to require that sidewalks be included whenever a road is constructed or reconstructed in a public right-of-way in an urban area. (See Appendix C)

**Maintenance of pedestrian access routes and accessible features**\
PROWAAC members recognized the importance of maintaining pedestrian access routes and features such as crosswalk locators and signals, railings, pavement markings and surfaces intended for use by people with disabilities. The committee also recognizes that state and local governments have a maintenance responsibility under the Department of Justice's rules barring discrimination on the basis of disability in state and local government services. However, the committee also recognizes that municipalities differ in how things are accomplished. For example, in some communities, adjacent property owners are required to construct sidewalks, to repair and maintain them, and to clear snow or other hazards from sidewalks. Some communities have the ability to establish proactive programs that look for problems and fix them, while others may only respond to citizen complaints.

Attempting to codify how and when state and local governments must identify problems and resolve them is beyond the scope of the committee. Public entities are encouraged to establish procedures that will assure that maintenance activities are undertaken by the responsible individuals and entities in ways that minimize inconveniences to individuals with disabilities, consistent with Department of Justice regulations.

The committee also attempted to provide information for temporary facilities and construction in the pedestrian access route, including options for warnings, signage and barricades, and alternate circulation paths. Examples of construction barricading standards which maintain pedestrian access routes during construction are available from communities such as San Francisco, California.

**Consistency with other reports**\
PROWAAC members attempted to be consistent with the recent recommendations of other Access Board subcommittees, such as the Recreation Access Advisory Committee and the Regulatory Negotiating Committee for Outdoor Developed Areas, regarding elements that are commonly found in parks, recreation areas, and related public rights-of-way. Some examples include benches, tables, trash receptacles, and artwork. The committee also attempted to be consistent with proposed ADAAG and used it as the reference standard to the extent practicable.

The committee identified some potential gray areas, such as whether the guidelines for the public rights-of-way or guidelines for recreation access should be applied in cases of shared use paths or trails within public rights-of-way. The Access Board will need to decide where each set of guidelines applies.

The committee coordinated their efforts with those of national transportation standard-setting organizations like the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and federal agencies such as the United States Department of Transportation to assure that recommendations are consistent with generally accepted practice among design professionals.

THE STRUCTURE AND FORMAT OF THIS REPORT

The recommendations of the PROWAAC for standards for construction in the public right-of-way are found in Part III of this report. These recommendations are briefly summarized in Part II, Executive Summary of Recommended Standards. Within the recommendations, information is provided in the form of recommended standards followed by a discussion section, as described below. Numbering has been done using a generic "X" to represent the number of the chapters that will eventually be assigned to the public rights-of-way accessibility guidelines. Where cross references to material in these recommendations or in proposed ADAAG are given, the sections are referenced. Terms that are defined in X01.2 are generally italicized the first time they appear in a numbered provision.

**Executive Summary**\
An executive summary is provided that highlights the recommended standards in this report and the list of recommended research. Each summary is a short list of the basic technical provisions of the associated standard. The summaries are provided for convenience; however, readers are strongly advised to consult the complete text of the standard language and its associated discussion section for a full understanding of the recommended requirements.

**Recommended Standards**\
These are recommendations from the PROWAAC to the Access Board on requirements to achieve accessibility in the public right-of-way. Standards are numbered and arranged according to a hierarchy: some standards have many sub-elements; others do not. Each standard or sub-element of a standard includes the following parts:

**Scoping Provisions**\
This part describes where the standard applies and which elements must meet the technical provisions.

**Technical Provisions**\
This part describes the specifications to meet the standard. Measurements in the technical provisions are provided in both English and metric units.

A standard or sub-element of a standard may also include the following elements:

**Figure(s)**\
Figures are provided as an aid to understanding the technical provisions. No technical provisions are specified in the figures that are not also specified in the text of the technical provisions.

**Advisory Notes**\
Advisories provide clarification and intent concerning the standards. In some cases, non-mandatory recommendations are included as guidance. With further research or discussion, these recommendations could be forwarded to the proposed rulemaking process.

**Discussion**\
The discussion for each standard offers insight for those who may draft proposed rules, as well as designers and end users, regarding issues that the committee considered and the rationale for their decision whether or not to include a recommended standard. This may be of interest particularly for those standards where full agreement among the committee was not achieved.

The discussion also includes issues that were considered to be "frontier issues," or issues requiring resolution, along with ***recommendations for additional action***, in the form of further research or in the form of questions for the Access Board to ask in rulemaking.

Frontier issues are defined as those issues identified by PROWAAC members for future study and rulemaking by the Access Board, which could not be addressed due to committee time constraints or need for additional research. Examples of these frontier issues include: final recommendations for applicability of new construction standards to alterations, and detailed definition of alterations; and acceptable surface treatments within and outside the pedestrian access route.

**Appendices**\
Eleven appendices to this report are provided. The first two appendices include information regarding the structure and function of the PROWAAC. The rest of the appendices provide clarification, or voice specific concerns which either reflect the consensus of the committee or minority opinions. Appendix C is a resolution urging those with the power to do so to mandate construction of sidewalks. Appendix D identifies preliminary concepts for applying the new construction standards in this report to alterations of existing work. Appendix E consolidates references within the body of the report regarding research needs, recommended questions, and frontier issues. Appendix F is a list of the acronyms and abbreviations used in this report. Subsequent appendices represent minority reports from individuals or groups represented on the committee who wished to highlight their concerns about specific issues.

Visual Contrast:

light-versus-dark comparison between two surfaces, an object and its immediate surroundings, or, an object and its perceived background. It is neither an expression of, nor achieved by, color differences. Visual contrast can be quantified with a luminance meter that measures the amount of light reflected by each subject (where zero is total darkness and 100 is theoretical complete light reflection). It is commonly expressed in percentage as Weber Contrast by the formula C = (RH - RL) Ö RH X 100, where C represents Weber Contrast, RH represents the reflectance level of the brighter surface, and RL the reflectance level of the darker.

**X01.3 Existing Public Rights-of-Way.**

**X01.3.1 General.**\
Additions and alterations to existing *public rights-of-way* shall comply with the provisions of this chapter.

**Discussion:** The committee recognizes that construction work in the public right-of-way consists largely of alterations to existing developed environments. Precedent-setting court cases, existing DOJ and DOT regulations under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Architectural Barriers Act, and the range and complexity of public right-of-way design and construction variables make it impossible to develop national standards applicable to all conditions that may be encountered in a local alterations project. Accordingly, the committee deferred to the requirements for alterations in the DOJ title II regulation, which states that:\
"each facility or part of a facility altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, if the alteration was commenced after January 26,1992."

This requirement should be broadly understood to require alterations to conform to each provision of the accessibility standard for new construction wherever that is feasible. Where it is technically infeasible in alterations to meet a new construction provision, the maximum feasible accessibility must be provided within the constraints of that particular situation.

While many questions were posed by and to the committee to clarify the terms "to the maximum extent feasible" and "technical infeasibility", the committee did not take action to establish a separate set of standards for alterations, except in a few instances. Notwithstanding the constraints of time imposed upon the committee, the committee believed that setting lesser standards for public sidewalk and curb ramp slope, warp and flatness, running slope, side flares, curb ramp skew, and directionality would serve only to lower the bar on alterations for those elements and features that might be made accessible in the course of public sidewalk or roadway alteration. Case-by-case professional design judgment, informed by an understanding of the rationale behind access provisions, must be applied to develop the most usable solution for each specific environment. The committee will rely on anticipated technical assistance in guidelines to be developed by the Access Board, in conjunction with any final rule and possible future committee work, to provide further clarification as to best practices in the industry.

**X01.3.2 Additions.**\
Each addition to an existing *public right-of-way* shall comply with the requirements for new construction.

**X01.3.3 Alterations.**\
Where existing *elements* or *spaces* in the *public right-of-way* are *altered*, each *altered* *element* or *space* shall comply with the applicable provisions of this chapter.

**EXCEPTIONS:**\
1\. In *alterations*, where compliance with applicable provisions is technically infeasible, the *alteration *shall provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible. Any elements or spaces of the public right-of-way that are being altered and can be made accessible shall be made accessible within the scope of the* alteration*.

2\. In alterations to public rights-of-way in a qualified historic district, where the State Historic Preservation Officer or appropriate advisory group determines that compliance with the requirements for *pedestrian access routes*, *ramps*, entrances, *crosswalks* or *public sidewalks *would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the public right-of-way or facility, the alternative alteration provisions for that element shall be permitted to apply. The purpose of the qualified historic district or site must be considered before the alterations provisions for historic properties shall apply and shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.

**Discussion:** Qualified historic properties are allowed alternative alteration provisions in the ADA, as well as current and proposed ADAAG. These provisions allow certain historic preservation principles to limit the extent to which a historic property is fully required to comply with the alterations provisions of ADAAG. Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 35.150(a)(2) says a program shall be accessible but that this requirement does not "require a public entity to take any action that would threaten or destroy the historic significance of an historic property." However, the commentary states that "the special limitation on program accessibility set forth in paragraph (a)(2) is applicable only to historic preservation programs, as defined in 35.104." Section 35.104 states, "Historic preservation programs means programs conducted by a public entity that have preservation of historic properties as a primary purpose." Therefore, the historic properties provisions apply only to sites where historic preservation is the primary purpose. It is the intent of the committee to create an analog for the current and proposed ADAAG provisions to be applied to the public right-of-way environment. However, the committee wanted to ensure that the alternative alteration provision under this part was not broadly construed to apply to all sites or elements within a historic district, unless the primary purpose of that site or element was historic preservation.

**X01.3.3.1 Prohibited Reduction in Access**. It is prohibited to make an alteration that decreases or has the effect of decreasing the accessibility of a public right-of-way or site arrival points to buildings or facilities adjacent to the altered portion of the public right-of-way, below the requirements for new construction at the time of the alteration.

**Discussion: **The committee considered text that would require the provision of a pedestrian access route to every address served by a blocked public sidewalk. This would ensure that coincident construction could not eliminate public sidewalks and curb ramps necessary to maintain access. This was deferred as a maintenance issue under the 'Maintenance of Accessible Features' provision in the DOJ title II regulation

**X01.3.3.2 Extent of Application.** An alteration of an existing element, space, or area of a public right-of-way shall not impose a requirement for accessibility greater than required for new construction.

X02 New Construction: Minimum Requirements: X02.1 Public Sidewalks
------------------------------------------------------------------

#### X02.1 Public Sidewalks

**X02.1.1 General**.\
Where provided, *public sidewalks* shall comply with this section.

#### X02.1.2 Pedestrian Access Route

**X02.1.2.1 General.** Where *public sidewalks* are provided, they shall contain a *pedestrian access route*. The pedestrian access route shall connect to elements required to be accessible in Section X02.3 and shall meet the requirements set forth in Section X02.1.1 through Section X02.1.7.

**Discussion:** The pedestrian access route must comply with the provisions of Section X02.1.1 through Section X02.1.7. However, if the public sidewalk is wider than the pedestrian access route, the portion of the public sidewalk outside the pedestrian access route is not required to comply with these sections. While the pedestrian access route is designed to be universally accessible, there are additional elements in the public sidewalk, such as stairs and handrails, that are used by some pedestrians with disabilities. These elements must also meet applicable standards in order to be accessible to those who choose to use them. The committee had a lengthy discussion of planning the public/private interface at the edge of the right-of-way to ensure access to new construction and to remove barriers to existing private sites and facilities that abut a new or altered public sidewalk. However, it was determined that conditions in the public right-of-way are so variable that it would be impossible to develop a provision covering such public/private coordination. The Access Board will use best practices case studies that illustrate a range of approaches as they develop technical assistance information during 2001.

**X02.1.2.2 Reduced Vibration Zone.** Within the pedestrian access route, there shall be an unobstructed *reduced vibration zone* meeting the requirements of this section. The reduced vibration zone shall be a contiguous part of the pedestrian access route that connects to elements required to be accessible in Section X02.3, and shall meet the requirements set forth in Section X02.1.1 through Section X02.1.7.

***Advisory:** : The reduced vibration zone is intended to result in an unobstructed, smooth, and navigable path that is aligned to be as direct and free of meanders as possible.*

**Discussion:** The reduced vibration zone is a "path within a path;" that is, it may be wholly contained within the width of the pedestrian access route. Some pedestrians using wheelchairs or other mobility aids experience pain or difficulty when rolling over rough or jointed surfaces, which may preclude their ability to use the public sidewalk. The reduced vibration zone is intended to provide a place within the pedestrian access route where such impediments are minimized, while still allowing some design freedom within the remaining public sidewalk area.

**Research need:** The committee wished to adopt a standard for the smoothness of the pedestrian access route but was not able to identify suitable technical provisions, such as a measurement of the rolling vibration of pedestrian surfaces. Paved surfaces for vehicles are evaluated according to a roughness index (the IRI) for which there is an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) measurement protocol that employs a profilometer. The committee encourages research to determine if the IRI could be adapted to the evaluation of pedestrian surfaces. The committee believes that research on the relationship of surface roughness, surface wavelength (amplitude and frequency), and caster and wheel diameter and materials may also be a fruitful area for research. In addition, ASTM standards are currently being developed for application in Hawaii. The committee recommends review of the Hawaii standard when available for possible incorporation into any new guidelines.

#### X02.1.3 Clear Width

**X02.1.3.1 General.** The minimum clear width of a pedestrian access route shall be 60 inches (1525mm), exclusive of the width of the curb. Within the pedestrian access route, the minimum clear width of the *reduced vibration zone* shall be 48 inches (1220mm), exclusive of the width of the curb.

***Advisory:** Designers are encouraged to provide additional width where possible, especially in high use areas such as in downtown urban environments, near shopping centers, schools, civic facilities. It is recommended that the pedestrian access route be no less than 72 inches wide in high use areas.*

**Discussion:** It is the intent of this section to create a minimum safe navigation passage for people with disabilities. People with disabilities will be able to navigate the pedestrian access route more safely if the route is easily discernible and obstacles are eliminated. Public sidewalks that are at least 60 inches wide are the minimum width for turning a wheelchair and for allowing two wheelchair users to pass each other. The Access Board's* Accessible Rights of Way: A Design Guide* states that: 1) some pedestrians who use crutches need as much as 42 inches (1065mm) in width to achieve a comfortable gait; and 2) an individual traveling with a service animal or sighted guide will use a minimum of 48 inches (1220mm) of width for easy passage. Also, a 72-inch (1830mm) public sidewalk allows for two wheelchair users to travel side by side, provides a manageable area for a crutch user and a wheelchair user, and is the recommended minimum width for public sidewalks in high use areas. The curb width should not be used in calculating the width of the pedestrian access route since there is a possibility of a person with mobility impairment traveling at the outer edge and falling off the curb. It is helpful to think of a 48-inch-wide corridor of the pedestrian access route as "inviolate," the minimum to which the pedestrian access route can be reduced, corresponding with the continuous reduced vibration zone.

**EXCEPTIONS:\
1\. Driveways and alleyways.** Where *public sidewalks* intersect *driveways* or alleyways, the width of the pedestrian access route may be reduced to 48 inches (1220mm) across the driveway.

***Advisory:** Excessive cross slope or change in cross slope on driveway aprons can be a significant barrier to public sidewalk use. Even with narrow public sidewalks along the curb, it is possible to design a public sidewalk to pass across the driveway apron without exceeding the 1:48 cross slope limitation. Existing non-complying aprons can be reconstructed to achieve a usable cross slope for a width of 48 inches. By breaking the driveway apron into three parts Ð the apron on the roadway side, the sidewalk, and the apron on the property side Ð vehicles must slow to negotiate the two steeper ramps on either side of the sidewalk crossing. When properly designed and constructed, these driveways will not cause vehicles to "bottom out."*

The after view shows transition ramps approaching a lowered driveway apron which allows a 48-inch wide PAR with 1:48 cross slope to complete the connection.*

**(EXCEPTIONS to X02.1.3.1, continued)\
2\. Parallel parking**. Where parallel parking spaces are provided adjacent to existing *public sidewalks*, and site constraints do not allow full compliance with the requirements of this section, the width of the pedestrian access route may be reduced to 48 inches (1220mm).

**3\. Accessible building entrances.** Where construction is permitted in the sidewalk to provide an accessible entrance to an existing adjoining property, and site constraints do not allow full compliance with the requirements of this section, the width of the pedestrian access route may be reduced to 48 inches (1220 mm).

**4\. Street fixtures.** Where insufficient *public right-of-way* is available to locate street fixtures outside the 60 inch (1525mm) minimum clear width, the pedestrian access route may be reduced to 48 inches (1220mm) for a length of 24 inches (610mm) maximum, provided that reduced width segments are separated by segments of the pedestrian access route that are 60 inches (1525mm) minimum in length and 60 inches (1525mm) minimum in width.

***Advisory:** Placement of street fixtures should be outside the usable area of the public sidewalk (the pedestrian access route plus any other area intended for pedestrian travel) to the maximum extent feasible.*

**Figure X02.1 C Placement of Street Fixtures**

![Plan view of a wall and street fixtures in relationship to the public sidewalk. Illustrates that the width of the pedestrian access route may be reduced to 48 inches and minimum spacing of 60 inches between objects intruding into the full 60-inch pedestrian access route.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/X02.1C.gif)

*Plan view of a wall and street fixtures in relationship to the public sidewalk. Illustrates that the width of the pedestrian access route may be reduced to 48 inches and minimum spacing of 60 inches between objects intruding into the full 60-inch pedestrian access route.*

**Discussion:** The committee recognizes that public rights-of-way, unlike most corridors in buildings, are frequently the locations of numerous items of street furniture and fixtures that serve a wide variety of public and private purposes. In order to ensure that public sidewalks are accessible and usable by persons with disabilities, an unobstructed pedestrian access route must be provided. The committee also realizes that some flexibility is needed in placing utilities and other fixtures that share the public rights-of-way. Therefore, street fixtures, such as street light poles and bollards may be allowed to encroach slightly into the 60-inch pedestrian access route, though they should be located outside of the public sidewalk wherever possible. Street furniture, on the other hand, attracts stationary pedestrians, which can block the pedestrian access route further. Thus, fixed street furniture such as mailboxes, newspaper boxes, litter containers, benches, and bicycle racks should not be allowed within the pedestrian access route and should be located with their clear floor or ground space at the edge of public sidewalks wherever possible.

#### X02.1.4 Cross Slope.

**X02.1.4.1 General.** The *cross slope* of the *pedestrian access route* cross slope shall not exceed 1:48.

**Discussion:** This requirement is consistent with current and proposed ADAAG standards that set a maximum 1:48 cross slope on accessible routes.

#### X02.1.5 Grade.

**X02.1.5.1 General.** The minimum feasible *running grade* consistent with *grades* established for the adjacent roadway shall be provided in the *pedestrian access route*.

**EXCEPTION**: The running grade of a pedestrian access route may be steeper than the adjacent roadway, provided that the pedestrian access route grade is either:

1.  Less than 5%, or
2.  In compliance with Section X02.4, or
3.  In compliance with proposed ADAAG Section 405.

***Advisory:** : The grades of a pedestrian access route should be as flat and uniform as possible in order to maximize accessibility. When the grade of the adjacent roadway exceeds 5 percent, it may be possible to create an independent sidewalk and pedestrian access route that differs from the contiguous roadway. This may be accomplished by establishing a sidewalk profile that is higher or lower than the roadway profile or by using a switchback design of connected ramps and landings that allows for a lesser slope. Where sidewalk grades are contiguous with the adjacent roadway grades and are at a grade steeper than 5 percent, accessibility will be maximized if level landings and/or handrails can be provided.*

**Discussion:** Where public sidewalks are located on independent vertical and/or horizontal alignments that are not related to roadways, they should comply with current and proposed ADAAG.

In some locations it is not feasible to construct a roadway at less than a 5 percent *grade*, and right-of-way constraints or lot configurations may preclude separating the pedestrian access route significantly from the roadway. In such cases the *running grade* of the pedestrian access route may be as steep as the running grade of the roadway.

#### X02.1.6 Surfaces.

**X02.1.6.1 General.** The surfaces of the *pedestrian access route* shall comply with proposed ADAAG Section 302 and shall be as free of jointed surfaces and as visually uniform as possible.

**EXCEPTION:** Surfaces may contain control joints and similar joints that are associated with established construction practices for those surfaces or structures that include pedestrian access routes.

***Advisory:**** Individual paving units, bricks or other textured materials are examples of surfaces that are undesirable in the pedestrian access route because of the vibration they cause. They may, however, be used in the portions of the public sidewalk that do not contain the pedestrian access route. The purpose of the visually uniform surface is to provide uniformity in color along the pedestrian access route to avoid confusing persons with low vision.*

**Discussion: **The requirement related to joints in the surface of the pedestrian access route is intended to eliminate, to the greatest extent possible, surfaces that tend to cause the front end of a wheelchair to vibrate or bounce as one travels across the surface. For many people, this vibration can cause pain or muscle spasms, possibly leading to a loss of control and maneuvering ability of the wheelchair. Allowances need to be made for expansion and contraction of the sidewalk material. This smooth surface would also serve as a reliable, uniform surface for the placement of crutches, free of unpredictable surface anomalies. The ADAAG Manual, developed by the Access Board in July 1998, states in Section 4.5.4, "Irregular paved surfaces, where jointed surfaces may be recessed below the level of the paving unit, can disrupt wheelchair maneuvering even if the differences in level are less than 1/4 inch." As stated on page 20 of FHWA's Designing Sidewalks and Trails for Access, "Surface quality significantly affects ease of travel for walking aid users. Grates and cracks wide enough to catch the tip of a cane can be potentially dangerous for walking-aid users. Icy or uneven surfaces can also be hazardous because they further reduce the already precarious stability of walking-aid users." The FHWA document further states, in section 6.3.3.1.4, "Although asphalt and concrete are the most common surfaces for sidewalks, many sidewalks are designed using decorative materials such as bricks or cobblestones. Although these materials improve the aesthetic quality of the sidewalk, they may increase the amount of work required for mobility. For example, tiles that are not spaced tightly together can cause grooves that catch wheelchair casters. These decorative surfaces may also create a bumpy ride that can be uncomfortable to those in wheelchairs. In addition, brick and cobblestone have a tendency to buckle creating changes in level and tripping hazards for people with visual impairments as well as ambulatory pedestrians with mobility impairments. For these reasons, brick and cobblestone sidewalks are not recommended." Creative alternatives to brick sidewalks include: colored concrete (stamped to look like brick); or concrete sidewalks with brick trim which preserves the decorative quality of brick but is an easier surface to negotiate.

**Research need:** The committee recognizes the advantages of requiring public sidewalks to have a visually uniform pavement surface that is monochromatic except for uniformly repeating patterns or markings, which are locational, directional, or cautionary, and encourages the development of more specific guidelines in this area.

The committee understands that the Access Board and the Construction Specifications Institute will pursue the issue of visual contrast in a joint technical assistance project in 2001 and recommends including guidelines developed from this or other research identified during this project.

**X02.1.6.2 Utility covers, gratings and other covers.** Utility covers, gratings, and other coverings over below-grade construction shall not be placed within the minimum clear width of the *reduced vibration zone*.

***Advisory:****Placement of utility covers, gratings and other covers should be outside the entire public sidewalk to the maximum extent feasible.*

#### X02.1.6.3 Surface gaps at rail crossings.

**(A) General.** Where the pedestrian access route crosses rail systems at *grade*, the horizontal gap at the inner edge of each rail shall be constructed to the minimum dimension necessary to allow passage of railroad car wheel flanges and shall not exceed 2 1/2 inches maximum. This allowance for a gap of 2-1/2-inches shall expire four years after the Access Board publishes the final rule on public rights-of-way, after which time the maximum gap shall be in accordance with proposed ADAAG Section 302.3 without the exception allowed in proposed ADAAG Section 1003.

**EXCEPTION:** On tracks that carry freight rail, the maximum horizontal gap is permitted to be 3 inches. This allowance for a gap of 3 inches shall expire four years after the Access Board publishes the final rule on public rights-of-way, after which time the maximum gap shall be in accordance with proposed ADAAG Section 302.3 without the exception allowed in proposed ADAAG Section 1003.

***Advisory:****Horizontal gap width shall be measured from the gauge face of the rail to the edge of the pavement. Where track junctions occur at street intersections, the pedestrian access route should avoid being routed over the switch points or frogs, which of physical necessity involve greater gaps than flangeways, or over raised guard surfaces of girder rails at curves. Where practicable, newly constructed pedestrian paths should intersect rail crossings at right angles.*

**Discussion:** Current technology does not provide a practicable solution for eliminating large gaps in the surface around rails. However, any horizontal gap in the surface paving greater than 1/2 inch can trap a wheelchair wheel, which makes development of a filler or other solution an urgent need. The committee recognized that the technical requirements for such a filler are formidable, since a filler that did not work perfectly could result in derailment, but there was strong support on the committee for a recommendation that would provide some incentive to the railroad industry to undertake and complete research and development to remedy this dangerous condition.

**Research need:** The committee is concerned that no technology currently exists to ameliorate the hazardous flangeway gap where light and heavy rail lines cross pedestrian ways and recommends research on a practicable solution. The Association of American Railroads has proposed a Transportation Research Board (TRB) project for 2001-2004 to involve the user community of the Access Board, FHWA, State departments of transportation, local road and street agencies, transit agencies, the Federal Transit Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration.

**(B) Detectable warnings.** Where rail systems cross *pedestrian* facilities that are not shared with vehicular ways, such as *public sidewalks *and pedestrian plazas, a *detectable warning* shall be provided in compliance with Section X02.5.7.

***Advisory:**** Detectable warnings are not recommended at the trackway when the rail crossing is within the vehicular way, such as a trackway crossing a crosswalk within a roadway.*

**Discussion:** When a pedestrian who is blind or visually impaired is in the crosswalk, a detectable warning installed for a rail crossing could be confusing and be mistaken as an indication of the other side of the street or as a median refuge. The detectable warning at each sidewalk/street transition will provide an indication of the presence of vehicular traffic of any type within the vehicular way.

**X02.1.7 Changes in Level**.

**X02.1.7.1 General.** Where changes in level are permitted in the *pedestrian access route* they shall comply with proposed ADAAG Section 303.

***Advisory:**** Changes in level between 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch are highly discouraged, even if permitted when beveled, in the public right-of-way. Changes in level exceeding 1/4 inch should be spaced at least 24 inches apart in the predominant direction of pedestrian travel to accommodate the average wheelbase of a wheelchair.* 

**Discussion:** Abrupt changes in level can create surface bumps that jar the front wheels of a wheel chair and make passage difficult for people with mobility impairments. Decorative deeply stamped or heavily jointed surface treatments also provide for irregular, rough surfaces that preclude, make difficult, or make painful passage by persons who use wheelchairs and other mobility aids. An abrupt vertical change in level greater than 1/4 inch can impede forward travel with a wheelchair.

The committee considered limiting the number of abrupt vertical surface changes that exceed 1/4 inch that could be introduced along a length of the pedestrian access route. It was agreed that the standard 24-inch length of a wheelchair wheelbase could serve as a minimum distance between changes.

**X02.1.7.2 Changes in level at rail crossings.** Where the pedestrian access route crosses rail systems at *grade*, the surface of the pedestrian access route shall be level and flush with the top of the rail at the outer edge and between the rails.

#### X02.1.8 Stairs

**X02.1.8.1 General.** Where provided in *public right-of-way*, stairs shall comply with proposed ADAAG Section 504. Stairs shall not be part of the *pedestrian access route*.

**X02.1.8.2 Visual contrast at the leading edges of steps.** Each tread of stairs in the public right-of-way shall have a high *visual contrast* strip marking the full width of the tread for a depth of 2 inches minimum from the leading edge of the tread.

#### Figure X02.1 D Visual Contrast at Steps

*Isometric views of treads and risers indicating contrast strip at leading edge. One shows the strip limited to the flat surface of the tread, one shows the strip wrapping over the nose of the tread.*

**Discussion:** While stairways are not considered part of a pedestrian access route, they are often constructed at pedestrian grade separations that are also served by elevators or a ramping system that does provide accessibility. Often persons with low vision are also elderly and prefer to use stairs rather than ramps because of joint deterioration, which causes difficulty in negotiating ramps. Providing higher contrast and improved visibility of stairways significantly improves these users' ability to negotiate stairways. Marking the lead 2 inches of tread the full width of the step with a strip of high visual contrast or safety yellow material will improve visibility.

#### X02.1.9 Elevators and Lifts.

**X02.1.9.1 General.** Where provided in public rights-of-way, elevators shall comply with proposed ADAAG Section 407 and lifts shall comply with proposed ADAAG Section 408 and shall remain unlocked during the operating hours of the facility served by the elevator.

**Discussion:** The requirement that elevators and lifts remain unlocked is necessary to ensure that they are independently operable and available when the facility they serve is open for use by the public.

**Frontier issue:** The committee discussed the fact that larger wheelchairs and electric scooters are used more frequently in the outdoor environment and that the clear ground space of 32 inches by 48 inches provided in proposed ADAAG Section 408 may not accommodate these larger mobility aids. In some sections, such as for the approach to *push buttons*, the committee recommended a larger clear ground space. The committee suggests future work to establish a uniform recommendation on these dimensions for outdoor environments.

#### X02.1.10 Separation.

**X02.1.10.1 General.** Reserved

***Advisory:**** Designers should consider providing sidewalks with both a vertical and horizontal separation from the adjacent roadway. Vertical separation can be created through the installation of curbs. Horizontal separation should be at least 24 inches (610mm) wide, and can be created through the installation of landscaping or furniture zones for benches, planters, literature display boxes, or similar clearly defined features or surfaces that will help guide persons who may otherwise unintentionally enter the vehicular way.*

**Discussion:** The committee encourages the use of planting strips or similar distinct features or surfaces to separate the sidewalk from the roadway and curb, to provide an edge for visual and cane travel, to accommodate public sidewalk elements and furniture, and to help ensure the border width necessary to accommodate curb ramps.

The committee considered requiring the acquisition of sufficient ROW width to ensure public sidewalk accessibility. However, it was recognized that ROW conditions are so variable that it would not be possible to develop provisions applicable to a wide range of locations and circumstances.

#### X02.1.11 Edge Conditions.

1

**X02.1.11.1 General. **Reserved.

***Advisories:\
(A) Tactile and visual cues.****Pedestrians with visual impairments use visual and tactile boundaries (shorelines) for directional orientation. Public sidewalks with clearly defined edges will be more accessible for these pedestrians. Where public sidewalks abut other paved areas such as parking lots and pedestrian plazas, the use of a visually contrasting and tactile material at the edge of the pedestrian route is desirable.*

**Discussion:** Blind and low vision pedestrians use visual and tactile boundaries (shorelines) for directional orientation in the public right-of-way.

***(B) Edge Protection.** Edge protection adjacent to public sidewalks containing pedestrian access routes is desirable in many instances because persons with disabilities often have limited agility and therefore have difficulty recovering if they encounter an uneven or potentially hazardous edge condition. Where provided, edge protection should be a minimum of 18 inches (450 mm) wide and consisting of a physical barrier such as a beam, curb, wall, shrubbery, railing or fence is preferred.*

**Discussion:** The committee discussed the need for a safe edge condition along the public sidewalk. People with disabilities often have limited agility and need additional protection if there is a drop off or other potential hazard next to the public right-of-way. Where buildings abut the public sidewalk, they provide a clearly defined edge to the pedestrian circulation area. Where no building is present, a landscaped or other clearly defined space, level with the public sidewalk, provides a discernible edge for the pedestrian. Where the landscaped or other clearly defined space is not generally level or cannot be provided, or where slopes steeper than 1:3 abut the sidewalk, other edge protection should be considered.

#### X02.1.12 Handrails.

**X02.1.12.1 General.** Where provided in the *public right-of-way*, *handrails* shall comply with proposed ADAAG Section 505.

***Advisory:** Placement of the handrail extension return at a height lower than 27 inches will improve detectability for blind pedestrians.*

#### X02.1.13 Parking structure exit warnings.

**X02.1.13.1 General. **Reserved.

***Advisory:****Where the public sidewalk crosses a vehicular exit for a parking structure, a vehicle-triggered audible and visual warning may be useful for all pedestrians, especially those with visual and hearing impairments. Research is needed to determine the specifications for such a warning system. Developers of parking structures are encouraged to provide drivers exiting the structure with an alert when a pedestrian is present.*

**Research need:** The committee recommends that the Board undertake research to determine the specifications for a warning system to alert pedestrians of the approach of a vehicle exiting a parking structure. The system should ensure consistency of interpretation. The committee recommends that the system:

1.  Have an alarm that will not be confused with an Accessible Pedestrian Signal;
2.  Have an alarm that will not be confused with a heavy vehicle back-up sound;
3.  Have an alarm that is volume responsive to ambient sound; 5 dB above ambient noise level, and a maximum of 89dB is suggested as a starting point.

The committee also recommends research on pedestrian sensor systems that can advise the exiting motorist of the presence of approaching pedestrian traffic.
