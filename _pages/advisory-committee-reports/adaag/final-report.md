### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FORMAT OF THE NEW ADAAG

In addition to the scoping and technical provisions presented in this report, the  Advisory Committee also recommends a new format for the next edition of ADAAG.  Recommendations regarding dimensions, defined terms, language style, and numbering are  already incorporated in the report; they are specified here for use by the Access Board.  This report does not incorporate the Committee recommendations for layout; figures and  commentary were not fully addressed by the Committee.
