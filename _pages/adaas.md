This edition of the ABA Accessibility Standards has been adopted by the General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).&nbsp;
(The USPS standards do not include the non-mandatory advisory notes.)&nbsp;
At this time, these standards apply to all facilities covered by the ABA except residential facilities under the purview of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Regulations and notices implementing the ABA standards include:

- [GSA's Federal Management Regulation](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-management-regulation-fmr?asset=119604#idtopicx2x71439) 
- [USPS notice](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2005-05-17/html/05-9745.htm)
- [DOD policy memorandum](index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=263&Itemid=1548)

HUD has not yet adopted this version of the standards and continues to apply the [Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS)](https://www.access-board.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1368&Itemid=1546) to residential facilities under its jurisdiction.

New provisions for outdoor areas developed by the federal government that address access to trails, picnic and camping areas, viewing areas, and beach access routes are included in this edition of the ABA standards.
