Self-driving or “autonomous” vehicles stand to revolutionize road transportation in the U.S. and around the world. Their cutting-edge technologies and engineering innovations have the potential to significantly expand transit options for many people, including those with disabilities. It is important that autonomous vehicles (AVs) are designed to be inclusive of everyone.   

This spring, the U.S. Access Board will host a four-part series of virtual meetings on making AVs accessible to passengers with disabilities. The Board will provide an open forum where members of the public and stakeholders can discuss considerations, challenges, and solutions in designing accessible AVs. The sessions will cover accessibility for passengers with mobility, sensory, or cognitive disabilities. The sessions are free and open to the public. Attendees will be able to pose questions and share comments, suggestions, and information. 

The Board is undertaking this initiative jointly with other agencies, including the Department of Labor’s Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) and the Department of Health and Human Service’s Administration for Community Living. 

### Series Platform and Format 

The forum will be conducted through the Zoom webinar. The forum’s four sessions will be in intervals of two weeks. Each 90-minute webinar discussion will be recorded and supplemented by an online crowdsourcing discussion platform (ePolicyWorks) that will be active for two weeks after each session. The sessions will begin with presentations by agency representatives and invited speakers who will review relevant sources and research and outline issues and questions for discussion. These presentations will be followed by an open dialogue with attendees through the webinar platform.

### ePolicyWorks Discussion Platform 

Members of the public are also welcome to share their ideas, comments, and information on AV accessibility through an online discussion platform (ePolicyWorks) that will offer another opportunity for dialogue throughout the webinar series.  Sponsored by ODEP, ePolicyWorks engages citizens and stakeholders and enables government to gather the public's input on key policy issues related to employment of people with disabilities.  Visit the [ePolicyworks](https://epolicyworks.ideascale.com/) website for further information on the platform. Registration for the dialogue on AV accessibility will open February 22.
