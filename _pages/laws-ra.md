# {{ page.title }} of 1973

The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires access to programs and activities that are funded by Federal agencies and to Federal employment.&nbsp;
The law also established the Access Board (section 502).&nbsp;
Later amendments strengthened requirements for access to electronic and information technology in the Federal sector (Section 508).&nbsp;
With passage the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, a new provision (section 510) was added to address access to medical diagnostic equipment.&nbsp;
The Board plays a lead role in developing and maintaining standards for electronic and information technology under section 508 and medical diagnostic equipment covered by section 510.
