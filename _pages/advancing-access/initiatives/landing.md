### Air Travel

The inability to use oneâ€™s wheelchair on airplanes makes air travel very difficult, if not impossible, for many people with disabilities. Among other challenges, it requires multiple transfers between boarding chairs and aircraft seats, posing injury risks. To address these challenges, the Access Board commissioned a study to assess the feasibility of equipping aircraft with securement systems and developed onboard wheelchair voluntary guidelines. Visit the Access Board's [Aircraft page]({{ site.baseurl }}/aircraft/) for more information.

### Autonomous Vehicles

Self-driving cars, shuttles, and other vehicles stand to revolutionize transportation and have the potential to dramatically expand transit options for people with disabilities. Their cutting-edge technologies and engineering innovations have the potential to significantly expand transit options for many people, including those with disabilities. It is important that autonomous vehicles (AVs) are designed to be inclusive of everyone. Visit the Access Board's [AV page]({{ site.baseurl }}/av/) for more information.

### Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

The Access Board will be releasing guidance on making electric vehicle (EV) charging stations accessible.

### Self-service Transaction Machines

Self-service transaction machines (SSTMs) and self-service kiosks are now a common feature in places of public accommodation, government offices, and other facilities. They allow customers to conduct an expanding range of transactions and functions independently. However, SSTMs and self-service kiosks have long posed accessibility barriers to people with disabilities, particularly those who are blind or have low vision.
