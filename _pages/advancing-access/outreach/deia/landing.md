### Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce
President Bidenâ€™s Executive Order to Advance Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce (EO 14035) calls on federal agencies to ensure that their facilities are fully accessible to employees with disabilities as required by the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA).  Agencies also must maximize the accessibility of their workplaces to reduce the need for reasonable accommodations.  The EO requires the U.S. Access Board to work with OMB, OPM, and GSA to support agencies in achieving these goals.

The Board developed its [DEIA Strategic Plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/deia-strategic-plan/)

The Board also developed a set of [DEIA recommendations and resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/deia-recommendations/) to aid agencies in drafting the portions of their strategic plans required under Executive Order 14035 dealing with accessibility.
