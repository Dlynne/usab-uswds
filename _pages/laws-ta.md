# {{ page.title }} of 1996 (Section 255)

The Telecommunications Act of 1996, a comprehensive law overhauling regulation of the telecommunications industry, recognizes the importance of access to telecommunications for people with disabilities in the Information Age.&nbsp;
Section 255 of the Act requires telecommunications products and services to be accessible to people with disabilities.&nbsp;
This is required to the extent access is <q>readily achievable,</q> meaning easily accomplishable, without much difficulty or expense.&nbsp;
If manufacturers cannot make their products accessible then they must design products to be compatible with adaptive equipment used by people with disabilities, where readily achievable.&nbsp;
What is <q>readily achievable</q> will be different for each manufacturer based on the costs of making products accessible or compatible and their resources.
