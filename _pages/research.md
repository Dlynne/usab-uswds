![stylized reach range diagram based on da Vinci Vitruvian Man sketch)](../img/vitruvian_man.jpg) The Board’s research program is focused on the study of accessibility relating to architecture and design, communication, and transportation.&nbsp;
A key mission of the Board is developing and maintaining accessibility guidelines and standards under several different laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).&nbsp;
This includes design requirements for facilities in the private and public sectors, transportation vehicles, telecommunications equipment, and Federal electronic and information technology.&nbsp;
Most Board research projects are designed to develop information for its use in writing or updating these design criteria.&nbsp;
The Board may fund the development of technical assistance and training materials useful to its audience, including designers, specifiers, and consumers.&nbsp;
However, research reports and guidance materials on this page were prepared under contract to the Access Board by independent contractors.&nbsp;
As such, they represent the analysis and views of the contractors only and are not a statement of Access Board policy or position.

The Board welcomes information on research initiatives related to accessibility and accessible design.&nbsp;
The Board maintains a strong interest in coordinating research with other entities and in exploring potential partnerships.&nbsp;
