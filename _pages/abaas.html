This edition of the ABA Accessibility Standards has been adopted by the General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).&nbsp; 
(The USPS standards do not include the non-mandatory advisory notes).&nbsp;
At this time, these standards apply to all facilities covered by the ABA except residential facilities under the purview of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
