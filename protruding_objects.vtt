00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:09.150
This animation explains requirements for protruding
objects in the ADA and ABA Standards.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.670
Objects that protrude into circulation paths
from walls or posts can be hazardous to people

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.510
with vision impairments. Common examples include
shelves, sconces, signs, kiosks, drinking

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:29.410
fountains, and monitors. The ADA and ABA Standards
set limits on the projection of such objects

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.169
depending on their mounting height.

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.060
Since people with vision impairments may not
need to travel along accessible routes, requirements

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.040
for protruding objects apply to all circulation
paths, including inaccessible routes. Unlike

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.820
most other provisions in the standards, they
are not limited to accessible routes or spaces

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.770
and encompass all ways of passage for pedestrian
travel, including walks, hallways, stairways,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.750
ramps, elevators and lifts, and courtyards.
The requirements apply to the entire width

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:09.560
of circulation paths. Both interior and exterior
circulation paths are covered by these provisions.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.000
People who are blind or who have low vision
sometimes travel along walls for orientation

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.600
or wayfinding, particularly in unfamiliar
environments. This technique is known as “trailing”

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.369
or “shorelining.” Objects that protrude
into circulation paths from walls, columns,

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.409
and other surfaces that are above the standard
sweep of long canes are hazardous unless properly

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.039
treated.

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.069
Objects that are mounted above a height of
80 inches provide minimum headroom clearance

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:42.560
and can protrude any amount.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.229
Those with leading edges at or below 27 inches
above the floor or ground can project any

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.310
distance from wall surfaces because they can
be detected by long canes without body contact.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.369
Providing detectability at heights well below
27 inches will allow more response time, especially

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.909
for people of short stature, children, and
users of short canes.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.340
Protruding objects with leading edges above
27 inches but no more than 80 inches high

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.670
are within the hazard zone. They are limited
to a protrusion of 4 inches or, in the case

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.230
of handrails, 4 ½ inches. Objects in this
range that exceed this limit must be properly

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.490
treated so that they do not pose safety hazards.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.610
One option for elements not required to be
within reach is to locate them so that they

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.200
provide a headroom clearance of at least 80
inches. Examples include signs not required

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.480
to be tactile and sconces.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.100
Another solution is to limit an object’s
projection into circulation paths to 4 inches,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.490
such as a counter at a service window. Or
the counter can be partially enclosed so that

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.790
it is detectable within the 27” high maximum
cane sweep. The leading edge of the counter

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.160
cannot project more than 4 inches from the
detectable portion that is within cane sweep.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.201
A side approach for wheelchair access is permitted
to sales and service counters. However, at

00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:16.020
other elements where a forward approach is
required or preferred, solutions cannot obstruct

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.780
required clearances for knees and toes. Side
panels provide a solution that will accommodate

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.570
access for a forward approach.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.811
In all cases, solutions must be fixed or built-in
so that they remain reliably in place. In

00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:35.860
new construction and alterations, moveable
elements or furnishings are not acceptable

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.760
alternatives in treating protruding objects.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.680
Extended wall surfaces and fixed cabinets
or enclosures below protruding objects can

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.740
be used at other elements such as monitors.
Treatments must extend to within 4 inches

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.320
of the leading edge of the protrusion.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.730
Note that some solutions may impact the height
of operable parts or controls that are required

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.670
to be within accessible reach range. The maximum
height is reduced when the reach extends over

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.850
an obstruction beyond a certain depth.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.120
Another option is to recess objects so that
the projection into circulation paths does

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.189
not exceed 4 inches. This is often a good
solution for cabinets, shelves, and display

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:20.829
cases.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.599
Fixtures such as cantilevered drinking fountains
can be recessed in alcoves. Fixed objects

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.950
such as benches, planters, or partitions can
be used to recess objects and to provide barriers

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.570
on both sides of a protruding object. When
recessing other types of elements in alcoves,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.159
be sure to accommodate the clear floor space
that is required for wheelchair access.

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.979
Wheelchair accessible drinking fountains must
provide a knee clearance at least 27 inches

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.630
high. If they are located so they provide,
but do not exceed, this clearance, they do

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.550
not require treatment as a protruding object
since the leading edge is on the boundary

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.729
of cane detection. Wheelchair accessible units
or bowls providing a knee clearance of exactly

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.300
27 inches can be used to enclose one side
of cantilevered drinking fountains that are

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.370
above the 27 inch height to serve standees.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.969
These requirements are not limited to wall-mounted
objects. They also apply to objects mounted

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:29.629
to partitions, columns, counters, and other
elements such as standpipes. Stand-alone objects

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.930
that are fixed or built-in are covered as
well where they protrude into circulation

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.370
paths. Examples include some types of kiosks
and sculptures.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.100
In the case of a fixed sculpture, a platform
or base can be used to provide cane detectability

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.370
at hazardous protrusions. The platform or
base should be high enough so that it is not

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.069
mistaken for a curb or step. A height of about
a foot will be sufficient, although the standards

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:02.410
do not specify a minimum. Railings and similar
elements that provide a leading edge no higher

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:09.630
than 27 inches also can be used. Barriers
or bases must extend to within 4 inches of

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:15.330
protrusions in the hazard zone. Even better,
consider extending them up to or beyond the

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.330
leading edge of hazardous protrusions.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:25.840
The standards also address protruding objects
mounted on posts or pylons, such as signs.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.460
As with wall-mounted objects, restrictions
apply to objects with leading edges within

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.691
the 27 inch to 80 inch height range. These
objects, however, are limited to a 12 inch

00:06:36.691 --> 00:06:39.669
protrusion into circulation paths.

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.900
It is advisable to limit their projection
to 4 inches as is required for wall-mounted

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.440
objects. A 4 inch limit is also specified
for post-mounted or free-standing objects

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.319
along streets and sidewalks in new guidelines
the Board is developing for public rights-of-ways.

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:02.819
At an element such as a map or display on
posts, compliance can be achieved by limiting

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:10.159
projections from posts to 12 inches. Leading
edges located within 27 inches from the floor,

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:17.009
like a horizontal rail, also will suffice
in providing detectability within cane sweep.

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:22.410
If the object is mounted so that the leading
edge is no higher than 27 inches, no additional

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:28.210
treatment is required. Maintaining a 27 inch
clearance will accommodate knee clearance

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:33.339
which is important where forward approach
access to an element is required. In this

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:39.259
case, such clearance will provide a closer
approach for wheelchair access to the display.

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:43.949
These requirements apply to all sides of an
object that can be approached from circulation

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:46.729
paths.

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:52.389
Headroom clearance of at least 80 inches is
required along all circulation paths.

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:57.340
Objects suspended from ceilings or mounted
on walls cannot protrude into this minimum

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.629
clearance.

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:03.589
Treatments for detectability are required
where the vertical clearance along circulation

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:09.380
paths is less than 80 inches, such as below
stairways that are not enclosed. This can

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:15.699
be achieved with fixed or built-in objects
like planters, benches, railings, and other

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:21.139
elements that provide an effective barrier.
Platforms or similar treatments should be

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:25.539
high enough so that they are not mistaken
for a step. It is important that solutions

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:30.040
be designed so that they do not pose tripping
hazards.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.610
These requirements also apply to curved or
sloped walls that reduce vertical clearance

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:41.759
below 80 inches along circulation paths. When
railings are used, they must be mounted so

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:47.210
that they provide a defined and detectable
edge that is located no more than 27 inches

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.230
high.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:54.449
In the case of sloped walls, if the depth
does not exceed 4 inches up to a height of

00:08:54.449 --> 00:09:01.360
80 inches, further treatment is not required.
Otherwise if the depth exceeds 4 inches, railings

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.170
or other barriers are must be provided.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:11.470
Further guidance on protruding objects and
other requirements in the ADA and ABA Standards

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.980
is available from the U.S. Access Board.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:20.710
This animation was developed by the U.S. Access
Board in cooperation with the Federal agencies

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.129
that issue the ADA and ABA Standards.
