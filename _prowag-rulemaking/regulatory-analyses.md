**6. Regulatory Analyses\
**

We prepared a preliminary regulatory assessment discussing the cost and
benefits of the proposed accessibility guidelines for pedestrian
facilities in the public right-of-way and an initial regulatory
flexibility analysis of the impacts on small governmental jurisdictions
with a population of less than 50,000 when the NPRM was issued. These
regulatory analyses are available on our website at:
http://www.access-board.gov/prowac/.

There is no database available on the number of shared use paths in the
United States. AASHTO surveyed five state transportation departments
when preparing comments on the ANPRM. The responding departments
reported approximately 1,500 to 3,000 miles of existing shared use paths
in their states. The Alliance for Biking and Walking surveyed more than
50 large cities about their bicycle and pedestrian
facilities.[4](regulatory-analyses.html#4) The average number of miles
of existing shared use paths per city was 70 miles, and ranged from 3.1
miles in Milwaukee to 328 miles in New York City. The cities used
federal funds to construct many of the shared use paths.

As discussed above, the proposed technical provisions applicable to
shared use paths are consistent with the AASHTO Guide. State and local
government entities that design and construct shared use paths generally
use the AASHTO Guide. The SNPRM is not expected to increase the costs of
constructing shared use paths for state and local government entities
that use the AASHTO Guide.

We request comments on the following to assess the impacts of the SNPRM:

-   The extent to which the AASHTO Guide, or other design guides and
    standards are used for shared use paths.
-   Whether any of the proposed provisions applicable to shared use
    paths would result in additional costs for design work, materials,
    earthmoving, retaining structures, or other items compared to
    construction practices or design guides and standards currently
    used? Commenters are encouraged to identify the specific provisions
    that would result in additional costs and estimate the additional
    costs on a per mile basis to the extent possible.
-   Whether any of the proposed provisions applicable to shared use
    paths would result in any additional costs, such as maintenance and
    operational costs, compared to current practices? Commenters are
    encouraged to identify the specific provisions that would result in
    additional costs and estimate the additional costs on a per mile
    basis to the extent possible.
-   What are the benefits of the proposed provisions applicable to
    shared use paths?

\
1 The FHWA defines a shared use path as a multi-use trail or path
physically separated from motorized vehicular traffic by an open space
or barrier, either within the highway right-of-way or within an
independent right of way, and usable for transportation purposes. The
FHWA definition of shared use path is available at:
<http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bicycle_pedestrian/guidance/design_guidance/freeways.cfm>.

2 For example, the Washington State Department of Transportation Design
Manual (July 2012) defines a shared use path as a facility physically
separated from motorized vehicular traffic within the highway
right-of-way or on an exclusive right-of-way with minimal cross flow by
motor vehicles. The Washington State Department of Transportation Design
Manual is available at:
<http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Publications/Manuals/M22-01.htm>.
