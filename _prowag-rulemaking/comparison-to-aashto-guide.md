<p><em>R302.3.2 Shared Use Paths.</em> A pedestrian access route shall be provided for the full width of a shared use path.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p><em>5.2.1 Width and Clearance</em></p>
<p>The minimum paved width for a two-directional shared use path is 10 ft (3.0 m). . . . In very rare circumstances, a reduced width of 8 ft (2.4 m) may be used . . . . Wider pathways, 11 to 14 ft (3.4 to 4.2 m) are recommended in locations that are anticipated to serve a high percentage of pedestrians (30 percent or more of the total pathway volume) and higher user volumes (more than 300 total users in the peak hour).</p>

<p><em>R302.5 Grade.</em> The grade of pedestrian access routes shall comply with R302.5.</p>
<p><em>R302.5.1 Within Street or Highway Right-of-Way.</em> Except as provided in R302.5.3, where pedestrian access routes are contained within a street or highway right-of-way, the grade of pedestrian access routes shall not exceed the general grade established for the adjacent street or highway.</p>
<p><em>R302.5.2 Not Within Street or Highway Right-of-Way.</em> Where pedestrian access routes are not contained within a street or highway right-of-way, the grade of pedestrian access routes shall be 5 percent maximum.</p>
<p><em>R302.5.3 Within Pedestrian Street Crossings. </em>Where pedestrian access routes are contained within a pedestrian street crossing, the grade of pedestrian access routes shall be 5 percent maximum.</p>
<p><em>R302.5.4 Physical Constraints.</em> Where compliance with R302.5.1 or R302.5.2 is not practicable due to existing terrain or infrastructure, right-of-way availability, a notable natural feature, or similar existing physical constraints, compliance is required to the extent practicable.</p>
<p><em>R302.5.5 Regulatory Constraints. </em>Where compliance with 302.5.1 or 302.5.2 is precluded by federal, state, or local laws the purpose of which is to preserve threatened or endangered species; the environment; or archaeological, cultural, historical, or significant natural features, compliance is required to the extent practicable.</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p><em>5.2.7 Grade</em></p>
<p>The maximum grade of a shared use path adjacent to a roadway should be 5 percent, but the grade should generally match the grade of the adjacent roadway. Where a shared use path runs along a roadway with a grade that exceeds 5 percent, the sidepath grade may exceed 5 percent but must be less than or equal to the roadway grade. Grades on shared use paths in independent rights-of-way should be kept to a minimum. Grades steeper than 5 percent are undesirable because the ascents are difficult for many path users, and the descents can cause some users to exceed the speeds at which they are competent or comfortable. . . . Grades on paths in independent rights-of-way should also be limited to 5 percent maximum.</p>

<p><em>R302.6 Cross Slope.</em> Except as provided in R302.6.1 and R302.6.2, the cross slope of pedestrian access routes shall be 2 percent maximum.</p>
<p><em>R302.6.1 Pedestrian Street Crossings Without Yield or Stop Control.</em> Where pedestrian access routes are contained within pedestrian street crossings without yield or stop control, the cross slope of the pedestrian access route shall be 5 percent maximum.</p>
<p><em>R302.6.2 Midblock Pedestrian Street Crossings.</em> Where pedestrian access routes are contained within midblock pedestrian street crossings, the cross slope of the pedestrian access route shall be permitted to equal the street or highway grade.</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p><em>5.2.5 Cross Slope</em></p>
<p>As described in the previous section, 1 percent cross slopes are recommended on shared use paths, to better accommodate people with disabilities and to provide enough slope to convey surface drainage in most situations.</p>

<td valign="top">
<p><em>R302.7 Surfaces. </em>The surfaces of pedestrian access routes and elements and spaces required to comply with R302.7 that connect to pedestrian access routes shall be firm, stable, and slip resistant and shall comply with R302.7.</p>
<p><em>R302.7.1 Vertical Alignment.</em> Vertical alignment shall be generally planar within pedestrian access routes (including curb ramp runs, blended transitions, turning spaces, and gutter areas within pedestrian access routes) and surfaces at other elements and spaces required to comply with R302.7 that connect to pedestrian access routes. Grade breaks shall be flush. Where pedestrian access routes cross rails at grade, the pedestrian access route surface shall be level and flush with the top of rail at the outer edges of the rails, and the surface between the rails shall be aligned with the top of rail.</p>
<p><em>R302.7.2 Vertical Surface Discontinuities</em>. Vertical surface discontinuities shall be 13 mm (0.5 in) maximum. Vertical surface discontinuities between 6.4 mm (0.25 in) and 13 mm (0.5 in) shall be beveled with a slope not steeper than 50 percent. The bevel shall be applied across the entire vertical surface discontinuity.</p>
<p><em>R302.7.3 Horizontal Openings</em>. Horizontal openings in gratings and joints shall not permit passage of a sphere more than 13 mm (0.5 in) in diameter. Elongated openings in gratings shall be placed so that the long dimension is perpendicular to the dominant direction of travel.</p>
<p><em>R302.7.4 Flangeway Gaps</em>. Flangeway gaps at pedestrian at-grade rail crossings shall be 64 mm (2.5 in) maximum on non-freight rail track and 75 mm (3 in) maximum on freight rail track.</p>

<td valign="top">
<p><em>5.2.9 Surface Structure</em></p>
<p>Hard, all-weather pavement surfaces are generally preferred over those of crushed aggregate, sand, clay, or stabilized earth. . . . Unpaved surfaces may be appropriate on rural paths, where the intended use of the path is primarily recreational, or as a temporary measure to open a path before funding is available for paving. Unpaved pathways should be constructed of materials that are firm and stable. . . . It is important to construct and maintain a smooth riding surface on shared use paths. . . . Utility covers (i.e., manholes) and bicycle-compatible drainage grates should be flush with the surface of the pavement on all sides. . . . Railroad crossings should be smooth and should be designed at an angle between 60 and 90 degrees to the direction of travel to minimize the possibility of falls.</p>

<p><em>R210.3 Shared Use Paths.</em> Objects shall not overhang or protrude into any portion of a shared use path at or below 2.4 m (8.0 ft) measured from the finish surface.</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p><em>5.2.1 Width and Clearance</em></p>
<p>The desirable vertical clearance to obstructions is 10 ft (3.0 m). Fixed objects should not be permitted to protrude within the vertical or horizontal clearance of a shared use path. The recommended minimum vertical clearance that can be used in constrained areas is 8 ft (2.4 m).</p>

<p><em>R304.5.1.2 Shared Use Paths</em>. In shared use paths, the width of curb ramps runs and blended transitions shall be equal to the width of the shared use path.</p>
<p>R305.1.4 Size. Detectable warning surfaces shall extend 610 mm (2.0 ft) minimum in the direction of pedestrian travel. At curb ramps and blended transitions, detectable warning surfaces shall extend the full width of the ramp run (excluding any flared sides).</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p><em>5.3.5 Other Intersection Treatments</em></p>
<p>The opening of a shared use path at the roadway should be at least the same width as the shared use path itself. If a curb ramp is provided, the ramp should be the full width of the path, not including any flared sides if utilized. . . . Detectable warnings should be placed across the full width of the ramp.</p>
