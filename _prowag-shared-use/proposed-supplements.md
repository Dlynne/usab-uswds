We are issuing this SNPRM to include specific provisions for shared use
paths in the proposed accessibility guidelines for pedestrian facilities
in the public right-of-way published in the Federal Register on July 26,
2011. See [76 FR 44664](https://www.access-board.gov/prowac/nprm.htm)
(July 26, 2011). The proposed accessibility guidelines for pedestrian
facilities in the public right-of-way will be codified as an appendix to
36 CFR part 1190. The SNPRM would supplement the following sections of
the proposed accessibility guidelines for pedestrian facilities in the
public right-of-way: R105.5 Defined Terms; R204 and R302 Pedestrian
Access Routes; R210 Protruding Objects; R218 Doors, Doorways, and Gates;
and R304 Curb Ramps and Blended Transitions. The proposed supplements to
these sections are set forth below.

*R105.5 Defined Terms.*

*Shared Use Path*

The SNPRM would add a proposed definition of shared use path in R105.5
to read as follows:

> *Shared Use Path.* A multi-use path designed primarily for use by
> bicyclists and pedestrians, including pedestrians with disabilities,
> for transportation and recreation purposes. Shared use paths are
> physically separated from motor vehicle traffic by an open space or
> barrier, and are either within the highway right-of-way or within an
> independent right-of-way.

The proposed definition is based on the AASHTO Guide, which defines a
shared use path as a bikeway physically separated from motor vehicle
traffic by an open space or barrier, and either within the highway
right-of-way or within an independent right of way. The AASHTO Guide
notes that pedestrians, including pedestrians with disabilities, also
use shared use paths and that they can serve transportation and
recreation purposes. See AASHTO Guide, 5.1 Introduction. The U.S.
Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
defines a shared use path similar to the AASHTO
Guide.[1](proposed-supplements.html#1) State transportation departments
also define shared use paths similar to the AASHTO
Guide.[2](proposed-supplements.html#2)

As noted in the AASHTO Guide, the primary factor that distinguishes
shared use paths and sidewalks is the intended user. Shared use paths
are designed for use by bicyclists and pedestrians, including
pedestrians with disabilities. Sidewalks are designed for use by
pedestrians, including pedestrians with disabilities, and are not
intended for use by bicyclists. See AASHTO Guide, 5.2.2, Shared Use
Paths Adjacent to Roadways (Sidepaths).

*Public Right-of-Way*

The SNPRM would revise the proposed definition of public right-of-way in
R105.5 to read as follows:

> *Public Right-of-Way.* Public land acquired for or dedicated to
> transportation purposes, or other land where there is a legally
> established right for use by the public for transportation purposes.

The NPRM proposed to define public right-of-way as public land or
property, usually in interconnected corridors, that is acquired for or
dedicated to transportation purposes. Some shared use paths may cross
private land. In these situations, an easement or other legal means is
used to establish a right for the public to use the portion of the land
that the shared use path crosses for transportation purposes. The SNPRM
would revise the proposed definition of public right-of-way to include
these situations.

*R204 and R302 Pedestrian Access Routes*

The SNPRM would revise these sections relating to pedestrian access
routes.

*R204.2 Pedestrian Circulation Paths\
*

The SNPRM would revise R204.2 to read as follows:

> *R204.2 Pedestrian Circulation Paths.* A pedestrian access route shall
> be provided within pedestrian circulation paths located in the public
> right-of-way. The pedestrian access route shall connect to accessible
> elements, spaces, and facilities required by this document and to
> accessible routes required by section 206.2.1 of appendix B to 36 CFR
> part 1191 or section F206.2.1 of appendix C to 36 CFR 1191 that
> connect building and facility entrances to public streets and
> sidewalks.

As proposed in the NPRM, R204.2 would require a pedestrian access route
to be provided within sidewalks and other pedestrian circulation paths
located in the public right-of-way. The NPRM proposed to define a
pedestrian circulation path as a prepared exterior or interior surface
provided for pedestrian travel in the public right-of-way. See
[R105.5](proposed-supplements.html#1055). Sidewalks and shared use paths
are types of pedestrian circulation paths. As revised by the SNPRM, the
term \"pedestrian circulation paths\" in R204.2 includes sidewalks and
shared use paths.

*R302.3 Continuous Width\
*

The SNPRM would revise R302.3 to read as follows:

> *R302.3 Continuous Width.* Except as provided in R302.3.1 and
> R302.3.2, the continuous clear width of pedestrian access routes shall
> be 1.2 m (4.0 ft) minimum, exclusive of the width of the curb.
>
> *R302.3.1 Medians and Pedestrian Refuge Islands.* The clear width of
> pedestrian access routes within medians and pedestrian refuge islands
> shall be 1.5 m (5.0 ft) minimum.
>
> *R302.3.2 Shared Use Paths*. A pedestrian access route shall be
> provided for the full width of a shared use path.

As proposed in the NPRM, R302.3 would require pedestrian access routes
to be 4 feet wide minimum, except R302.3.1 would require pedestrian
access routes within medians and pedestrian refuge islands to be 5 feet
wide minimum to allow for passing space.

The SNPRM would add a new provision at R302.3.2 that would require a
pedestrian access route to be provided for the full width of a shared
use path since shared use paths are typically two-directional and path
users travel in each direction on the right hand side of the path,
except to pass. The AASHTO Guide recommends that two-directional shared
use paths should be 10 feet wide minimum. Where shared use paths are
anticipated to serve a high percentage of pedestrians and high user
volumes, the AASHTO Guide recommends that the paths should be 11 to 14
feet wide to enable a bicyclist to pass another path user travelling in
the same direction, at the same time a path user is approaching from the
opposite direction. In certain very rare circumstances, the AASHTO Guide
permits the width of shared use paths to be reduced to 8 feet. See
AASHTO Guide, 5.2.1 Width and Clearance.

*R302.5 Grade*

The SNPRM would revise R302.5 to read as follows:

> *R302.5 Grade.* The grade of pedestrian access routes shall comply
> with R302.5.
>
> *R302.5.1 Within Street or Highway Right-of-Way*. Except as provided
> in R302.5.3, where pedestrian access routes are contained within a
> street or highway right-of-way, the grade of pedestrian access routes
> shall not exceed the general grade established for the adjacent street
> or highway.
>
> *R302.5.2 Not Within Street or Highway Right-of-Way.* Where pedestrian
> access routes are not contained within a street or highway
> right-of-way, the grade of pedestrian access routes shall be 5 percent
> maximum.
>
> *R302.5.3 Within Pedestrian Street Crossings.* Where pedestrian access
> routes are contained within a pedestrian street crossing, the grade of
> pedestrian access routes shall be 5 percent maximum.
>
> *R302.5.4 Physical Constraints.* Where compliance with R302.5.1 or
> R302.5.2 is not practicable due to existing terrain or infrastructure,
> right-of-way availability, a notable natural feature, or similar
> existing physical constraints, compliance is required to the extent
> practicable.
>
> *R302.5.5 Regulatory Constraints.* Where compliance with R302.5.1 or
> R302.5.2 is precluded by federal, state, or local laws the purpose of
> which is to preserve threatened or endangered species; the
> environment; or archaeological, cultural, historical, or significant
> natural features, compliance is required to the extent practicable.

As proposed in the NPRM, R302.5 would require the grade of pedestrian
access routes contained within a street or highway right-of-way, except
at pedestrian street crossings, to not exceed the general grade
established for the adjacent street or highway; and the grade of
pedestrian access routes not contained within a street or highway
right-of-way to be 5 percent maximum. R302.5.1 would require the grade
of pedestrian access routes contained within a pedestrian street
crossing to be 5 percent maximum.

The SNPRM would renumber R302.5 to include a general provision in
R302.5; the specific provision for the grade of pedestrian access routes
contained within a street or highway right-of-way in R302.5.1; the
specific provision for the grade of pedestrian access routes not
contained within a street or highway right-of-way in R302.5.2; and the
specific provision for the grade of pedestrian access routes contained
within a pedestrian street crossing in R302.5.3.

The SNPRM would add new provisions at R302.5.4 and R302.5.5 that would
require compliance with the grade provisions in R302.5.1 or R302.5.2 to
the extent practicable where compliance is not practicable due to
physical constraints and where compliance is precluded by regulatory
constraints. We propose to add these new provisions in response to
public comments on the ANPRM, which included draft technical provisions
for grade similar to those proposed in the R302.5. The comments noted
that physical or regulatory constraints may prevent full compliance with
the grade provisions. Physical constraints would include existing
terrain or infrastructure, right-of-way availability, a notable natural
feature, or similar existing physical constraints. Regulatory
constraints would include federal, state, or local laws the purpose of
which is to preserve threatened or endangered species; the environment;
or archaeological, cultural, historical, or significant natural
features.

The proposed provisions are consistent with the AASHTO Guide. The AASHTO
Guide recommends that the grade of a shared use path should not exceed 5
percent; but, where the path is adjacent to a roadway with a grade that
exceeds 5 percent, the grade of the path should be less than or equal to
the roadway grade. The AASHTO Guide notes that grades steeper than 5
percent are undesirable because ascents are difficult for many path
users, and the descents can cause some path users to exceed the speeds
at which they are competent or comfortable. See AASHTO Guide, 5.2.7
Grade.

*R210 Protruding Objects*

The SNPRM would revise R210 to read as follows:

> *R210.1 General.* Protruding objects shall comply with the applicable
> requirements in R210.
>
> *R210.2 Pedestrian Circulation Paths Other Than Shared Use Paths.*
> Objects along or overhanging any portion of a pedestrian circulation
> path other than a shared use path shall comply with R402 and shall not
> reduce the clear width required for pedestrian access routes.
>
> *R210.3 Shared Use Paths.* Objects shall not overhang or protrude into
> any portion of a shared use path at or below 2.4 m (8.0 ft) measured
> from the finish surface.

As proposed in the NPRM, R210 would require objects along or overhanging
any portion of a pedestrian circulation path to comply with the proposed
technical provisions for protruding objects in R402 and to not reduce
the clear width required for pedestrian access routes.

The SNPRM would renumber R210 to include a general provision in R210.1
and a specific provision for pedestrian circulation paths other than
shared use paths in R210.2 that would require objects along or
overhanging any portion of the path to comply with the proposed
technical provisions for protruding objects in R402 and to not reduce
the clear width required for pedestrian access routes, as proposed in
the NPRM.

The SNPRM would add a new provision for shared use paths at R210.3 that
would prohibit objects from overhanging or protruding into any portion
of a shared use path at or below 8 feet measured from the finish
surface.

The proposed provision for shared used paths is consistent with the
AASHTO Guide. The AASHTO Guide recommends 10 feet vertical clearance
along shared use paths, and 8 feet minimum vertical clearance in
constrained areas. The AASHTO Guide recommends that fixed objects should
not be permitted to protrude within the vertical or horizontal clearance
of a shared use path. See AASHTO Guide, 5.2.1 Width and Clearance.

*R218 Doors, Doorways, and Gates\
*

The SNPRM would revise R218 to read as follows:

> *R218 Doors, Doorways, and Gates.* Except for shared use paths, doors,
> doorways, and gates provided at pedestrian facilities shall comply
> with section 404 of Appendix D to 36 CFR to 36 CFR part 1191.

The SNPRM would not apply the technical provisions for doors, doorways,
and gates referenced in R218 to shared use paths to avoid conflicts with
the AASHTO Guide. The AASHTO Guide does not recommend the use of gates
or other barriers to prevent unauthorized motor vehicle entry to shared
use paths because gates and barriers create permanent obstacles to path
users. The AASHTO Guide recommends alternative methods to control
unauthorized motor vehicle entry to shared use paths, including posting
regulatory signs prohibiting motor vehicle entry and targeted
surveillance and enforcement. Where there is a documented history of
unauthorized entry by motor vehicles despite the use of alternative
methods to control such entry, the need for bollards or other vertical
barriers may be justified. The AASHTO Guide includes recommended designs
for bollards where justified. The AASHTO Guide recommends the use of one
bollard in the center of the shared use path. Where more than one
bollard is used, the AASHTO Guide recommends an odd number of posts
spaced at 6 feet. The AASHTO Guide does not recommend two posts since
they direct opposing path users toward the middle, creating conflict and
the possibility of a head-on collision. See AASHTO Guide, 5.3.5 Other
Intersection Treatments.

*R304 Curb Ramps and Blended Transitions\
*

The SNPRM would revise R304.5.1 to read as follows:

> *R304.5.1 Width.* The width of curb ramps and blended transitions
> shall comply with 304.5.1.1 or 304.5.1.2, as applicable. If provided,
> flared sides of curb ramp runs and blended transitions shall be
> located outside the width of the curb ramp run or blended transition.
>
> *R304.5.1.1 Pedestrian Circulation Paths Other Than Shared Use Paths.*
> In pedestrian circulation paths other than shared use paths, the clear
> width of curb ramp runs, blended transitions, and turning spaces shall
> be 1.2 m (4.0 ft) minimum.
>
> *R304.5.1.2 Shared Use Paths.* In shared use paths, the width of curb
> ramps runs and blended transitions shall be equal to the width of the
> shared use path.

As proposed in the NPRM, R304.5.1 would require the clear width of curb
ramp runs (excluding flared sides), blended transitions, and turning
spaces to be 4 feet minimum.

The SNPRM would renumber R304.5.1 to include a general provision in
R304.5.1 that would clarify that if flared sides are provided at curb
ramps and blended transitions, the flared sides are to be located
outside the width of the curb ramp run or blended transition; and a
specific provision for pedestrian circulation paths other than shared
use paths in R304.5.1.1 that would require the clear width of curb ramp
runs, blended transitions, and turning spaces to be 4 feet minimum, as
proposed in the NPRM.

The SNPRM would add a new provision for shared use paths at R304.5.1.2
that would require the width of curb ramps runs and blended transitions
to be equal to the width of the shared use path.\
The proposed provision for shared used paths is consistent with the
AASHTO Guide. The AASHTO Guide recommends that where curb ramps are
provided on shared use paths, the curb ramps should extend the full
width of the path, not including any flared sides. See AASHTO Guide,
5.3.5 Other Intersection Treatments.
