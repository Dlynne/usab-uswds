This folder contains Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)

From About > Policy > Privacy

The E-Government Act of 2002 requires federal agencies to prepare Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for information systems that process personal information from or about members of the public. PIAs help identify and limit privacy risks, and serve as additional notice to the public about agency activities that may affect individualsâ€™ personal information.
