00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:11.800
This animation explains requirements for maneuvering
clearances at doors in the ADA and ABA Standards.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.620
Door maneuvering clearances provide space
so that people with disabilities, including

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:23.420
those who use wheelchairs, can approach and
open doors and proceed through doorways.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.210
Door maneuvering clearances are sized according
to the approach direction and the swing of

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.679
the doors.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:35.630
For most approaches, including a forward approach
as shown here, space is required beyond the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.800
latch side of doors.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.120
This provides room for optimum positioning
at door hardware.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.330
A latch side clearance of at least 18 inches
is required on the pull side for forward approaches.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.010
The clearance must be at least 60 inches deep.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.850
Projections into door clearances obstruct
maneuvering.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.500
Fixed objects such as shelves cannot protrude
into the required clearance anywhere along

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.580
the full height.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.000
Mobility aids vary greatly in their design
and size.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.570
Many people use power chairs, scooters, and
other alternatives to standard manual wheelchairs.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.330
Providing additional clearance beyond the
minimum specified will accommodate a broader

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.520
range of devices, including larger models,
by allowing more positioning and maneuvering

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.220
space.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.981
Maneuvering clearances also serve people who
use crutches, walkers, canes, and other mobility

00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:35.280
aids.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.670
As with wheelchair access, specified clearances
provide room for effective positioning at

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.740
doors.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.810
The maneuvering clearance is required to be
flush with the wall.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.380
An offset up to 8 inches from the face of
door is permitted.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.590
Where an offset would exceed 8 inches, such
as at deeply recessed doors, the maneuvering

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.950
clearance must be located 8 inches maximum
from the plane of the door and be sized for

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.510
a forward approach.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.469
Less space is needed on the push side of doors
than on the pull side.

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:18.999
Maneuvering space on the push side for a forward
approach must be at least 48 inches deep.

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:24.299
A minimum 12-inch clearance is required on
the latch side of doors that have both a closer

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.329
and a latch.

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:34.290
This additional clearance allows easier maneuvering
through doors against the force of closers.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.540
If a door does not have both a closer and
a latch, no additional clearance beyond the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.019
opening is required on the latch side.

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.629
Negotiating thresholds while proceeding through
doorways can be a challenge, especially where

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.680
doors have closers.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.310
Thresholds are limited to a height of one
half inch, and their edges must be properly

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.160
beveled.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.480
Thresholds no higher than a quarter inch can
have straight edges.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.689
Mobility aids, including wheelchair footrests,
are sometimes used to help push or prop open

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:09.999
doors.

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:15.760
For this reason, the bottom surface of doors
on the push side must be smooth to a height

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.269
of at least 10 inches.

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.069
Applied kick plates can be used to help protect
door surfaces.

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.199
The Standards also specify maneuvering clearances
for side approaches.

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:34.680
Hinge side approaches on the pull side require
more space than most other approaches due

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.909
to the maneuvering required.

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.000
All maneuvering clearances are illustrated
in the Standards.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.180
Maneuvering clearances are dimensioned based
on the approach direction, the swing of the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.859
door, and, in some cases, the presence of
a closer or latch.

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.870
At doors in series, a separation of at least
48 inches between the swing of doors provides

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.120
space to get through one door before encountering
the next.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.510
This required separation also applies where
doors swing away from or toward each other.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.260
Maneuvering clearances are required at each
accessible door, but they can overlap.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.070
At entry alcoves, it is beneficial, though
not required, to provide wheelchair space

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.090
beyond the swing of doors.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.310
As with doors in series, this provides enough
space to clear one door before proceeding

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.500
to the next.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.880
Exterior doors can be difficult to open due
to the weight of doors, wind loading, air

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.440
pressure, and other factors.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.810
While the force to open interior doors cannot
exceed 5 pounds, a maximum opening force is

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.639
not specified for exterior doors.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.470
Automating entrance doors is very helpful
although it is not required by the Standards.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.979
If doors are not automated, closers should
be adjusted to the minimum necessary for positive

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.210
latch.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.680
Controls for automated doors must comply with
specifications for operable parts, including

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.610
clear floor space.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.729
This space must be located outside the swing
of doors.

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:28.460
Controls should be located so that users can
conveniently proceed through activated doors.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.389
If space at the control is incorrectly located
within the door swing, users must hurry out

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.150
of the way to avoid getting hit by the door.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.830
Locating the control away from the door on
an adjacent wall, as shown here, or on a post

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.569
is beneficial because it provides clear floor
space beyond the door swing and allows a convenient

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:59.699
reach to the control and continuous forward
travel through the doorway.

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:06.539
Further guidance on accessible doors and other
requirements in the ADA and ABA Standards

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.020
is available from the U.S. Access Board.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.620
This animation was developed by the U.S. Access
Board in cooperation with the federal agencies

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.039
that issue the ADA and ABA Standards.
