00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.990
This animation explains requirements for accessible
bathing facilities in the ADA and ABA Standards.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.600
These Standards provide specifications for
transfer showers, roll-in showers, and bathtubs.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:24.500
At least one shower or bathtub must comply
in bathing facilities required to be accessible.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.699
Requirements for transfer showers allow users
with disabilities, including those who use

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.020
wheelchairs, to approach the stall, operate
controls from outside, and position for transfer

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.160
to shower seats.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.989
Grab bars opposite the seat and shallow thresholds,
one half inch maximum high, facilitate transfer

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.510
from wheelchairs and other mobility aids.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:01:00.570
Shower spray units must be located on the
side wall opposite the seat.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.049
Transfer shower stalls must be 3 feet wide
and 3 feet deep, measured to the center points

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.170
of walls.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.290
These are absolute, not minimum, dimensions
so that grab bars and shower controls are

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.040
within reach from the seat.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.170
Clear floor space at the compartment must
be at least 36 inches deep and 48 inches long.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.950
The length is measured from the control wall
so that the clear floor space extends beyond

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.440
the seat wall at least 12 inches.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.700
This clearance provides space to operate shower
controls and position for transfer.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.020
The additional space beyond the seat wall
allows proper alignment with the seat for

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:58.810
transfer.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.000
The front edge of shower seats must extend
15 to 16 inches from the seat wall.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.230
Gaps at the rear edge cannot exceed 2 and
a half inches.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.480
The seat must extend from the back wall to
a point within 3 inches of the compartment

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.580
entry.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.200
The side edge cannot be more than 1 and a
half inches from the back wall.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.760
The Standards also permit seats to be L-shaped.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.610
Under this option, a portion of the seat 14
to 15 inches wide extends 22 to 23 inches

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.010
from the seat wall.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.129
Roll-in showers are sized to accommodate mobility
aids and shower chairs without having to transfer

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.820
to a seat.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.470
They must be at least 30 inches deep and 60
inches long.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.069
Grab bars are required on all three sides.

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.790
Shower spray units and controls can be located
on the back wall or either side wall in stalls

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.320
not equipped with seats.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.910
Clear floor space in front of the shower at
least 30 inches by 60 inches provides room

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.909
to maneuver into and out of the stall and
for turning.

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.620
Transitions at showers must be smooth to accommodate
wheeled mobility aids.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.650
If a threshold is provided, it cannot exceed
half an inch and must be properly beveled

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.150
on both sides.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.040
Solutions such as trench drains that control
water without a threshold will provide easier

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.989
access.

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.549
Folding seats can be provided in roll-in showers
and are a good idea since they provide the

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.939
option to transfer from mobility aids.

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:53.360
They are also helpful to people with limited
balance or standing ability.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.519
If provided, a seat must be a folding type
that is permanently attached to a side wall.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.530
Grab bars are dimensioned so that they do
not overlap the seat.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.810
The shower spray unit and controls must be
located on the back wall within 27 inches

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.750
from the seat wall so that they are usable
from the seat.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.990
It is advisable, though not required, that
a foot of additional clear floor space be

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:27.270
provided beyond the seat wall to allow more
flexibility in positioning for transfer to

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.750
the seat, similar to the configuration required
at transfer showers.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.030
A lavatory can overlap a portion of the clear
floor space, but must be located on the side

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.140
opposite the seat so that transfer space remains
unobstructed.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.260
No other fixture is permitted to overlap the
shower clearance.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.140
An alternative to the standard roll-in shower
is permitted that allows the entry side to

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.320
be partially enclosed.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.420
The shower entry must be at least 36 inches
wide.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:07.390
The shower compartment is required to be 36
inches deep absolute.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.050
Grab bars are required on the back wall and
on the side wall farthest from the entry.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.790
The shower spray unit and controls also must
be located on this side wall unless a seat

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.320
is provided.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.380
This type of shower, like the standard roll-in
shower, can have a folding seat.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.240
Seats must be mounted on the front wall.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.060
This location provides clear space next to
the seat for transfer.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.270
The grab bar on the side wall is dimensioned
so that it does not overlap the seat.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:48.130
The shower spray unit and controls must be
located on the side wall 27 inches maximum

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.320
from the seat wall, or they can be mounted
on the back wall opposite the seat within

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.300
15 inches on either side of the seat centerline.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.990
Placement on the back wall is allowed only
when a seat is provided.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.260
The Standards also address access to bathtubs.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:14.780
Tub controls are located toward the open side
so that they are usable from outside the tub.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.990
A removable in-tub seat or a permanent seat
at the head end is required.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.360
Removable seats must attach securely when
in place so that they do not move or shift

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.210
during use.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:34.920
Grab bars on the back and side walls provide
support in transferring to and using seats.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:41.090
If a permanent seat is provided, a grab bar
on the head end wall is not provided because

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.170
it would interfere with use of the seat.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:50.760
The dual grab bars on the back wall must extend
to the edge of the seat so that they are usable

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.200
from the seat.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.080
These grab bars facilitate entry into the
tub from the seat.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.030
The required clear floor space at tubs must
be at least 30 inches wide and extend the

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.690
length of the tub.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:10.730
If a permanent seat is provided, the clear
floor space must extend at least 12 inches

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:16.260
beyond the head end wall to allow proper positioning
for transfer.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.970
A lavatory can overlap this clearance at the
control end only.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:27.730
The knee and toe space required below lavatories
also accommodates pull-up space at controls.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:34.950
It is advisable to keep lavatories outside
the tub clearance for easier access to tub

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.950
controls.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.470
No other fixture can overlap tub clearances.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:47.470
Further guidance on accessible bathing facilities
and other requirements in the ADA and ABA

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.340
Standards is available from the U.S. access
board.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:57.520
This animation was developed by the U.S. access
board in cooperation with the federal agencies

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.870
that issue the ADA and ABA Standards.
