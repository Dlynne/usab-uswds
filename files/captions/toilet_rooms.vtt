00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:09.780
This animation explains requirements for accessible
toilet rooms in the ADA and ABA Standards.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.379
Accessible toilet rooms must be on an accessible
route and have compliant doors so that people

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.680
with disabilities, including those who use
wheelchairs, can enter the space.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.880
Required clearances provide sufficient room
to enter, clear the door, turn around, and

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:46.000
close and lock the door.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.090
The clear floor space required at water closets
accommodates a variety of transfers, including

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.420
side transfers.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.160
Transfer techniques vary among users based
on personal preferences and abilities, room

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.040
layout, and other factors.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:14.420
Grab bars on the side and rear walls are critical
for transfer.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:27.440
Flush controls must be located on the open
side of the water closet.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.550
Clearances are also required at lavatories
and other elements, including soap dispensers,

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.980
towel dispensers, and hand dryers.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:02:07.470
The Standards include criteria for the usability
of faucet controls and other operable parts.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:23.150
Door maneuvering clearances provide room to
approach and open doors and to exit the space.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.849
The size of single-user toilet rooms is determined
by room layout, configuration of fixtures,

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.549
the swing of doors, and other factors.

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:40.640
Water closets can be located in any corner
of the room so that one side is open and unobstructed.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.969
The lavatory must be located outside the water
closet clearance.

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.790
This keeps the space beside the water closet
open for side transfers.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.129
The lavatory clear floor space, however, can
overlap the water closet clearance.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.079
Lavatories can be recessed so that they remain
outside the water closet clearance.

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.840
To accommodate this configuration, the rear
grab bar at the water closet is permitted

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.730
to be shortened from 36 inches to 24 inches
minimum.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.719
The maneuvering clearance required at doors
is configured according to the swing and approach.

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:28.249
This space must be clear of any obstructions
but can overlap other clearances.

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:35.010
Doors can swing into fixture clearances only
if clear floor space at least 30 by 48 inches

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.819
is available beyond the swing.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.389
This ensures sufficient space to clear the
door when entering the room.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:48.239
The location and orientation of this space
is not further specified, but it should be

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.760
positioned so that it can be easily accessed.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.689
Turning space is required within the room.

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:01.459
Turning space must be either a 60-inch diameter
circle or T-shaped.

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.469
This space can overlap fixture and door maneuvering
clearances.

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:11.829
Doors can swing into the turning space under
any condition.

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.720
Rooms with doors that swing out usually can
be smaller since less maneuvering clearance

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.150
is required on the push side of doors.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.410
On the push side, a strike side clearance
of at least 12 inches is required for a forward

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.110
approach if the door has both a closer and
latch.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.590
Otherwise, no strike side clearance is required
on the push side.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.400
Where doors swing out, turning space may further
determine the minimum size of the room.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.510
Lavatories and other fixtures with knee and
toe space can overlap a portion of the turning

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.290
space.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.570
These requirements apply to all types of room
layouts.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.150
For example, in the case of a room with a
lavatory opposite the water closet, the same

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.090
requirements apply, including:
Minimum clearances at the water closet and

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.560
the lavatory, and any other provided fixtures;
Door maneuvering clearance unobstructed by

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.510
any fixtures;
Location of the door swing outside fixture

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.690
clearances (unless wheelchair space beyond
the door swing is provided in the room); and

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:34.020
Turning space, which can overlap fixture and
door clearances and the arc of the door swing.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.500
These requirements apply equally to other
layouts.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.650
In this example, the door swing can overlap
fixture clearances because wheelchair space

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.150
is available beyond the door swing.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.870
Access is required to multi-user toilet rooms
where provided, even if other accessible restrooms

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:03.970
are available.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.220
At least one lavatory must be accessible.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.010
A compliant urinal is required where more
than one urinal is provided.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:20.120
At least one toilet compartment must be wheelchair
accessible in all multi-user restrooms.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.110
The compartment opening is offset from the
water closet to provide space for entry and

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.800
positioning for transfer.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.700
Toe clearance below one side partition and
the front partition provides additional maneuvering

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.860
space.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.540
A second compartment is required in rooms
with six or more toilet compartments or a

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.650
combined total of six or more compartments
and urinals.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.240
This compartment is designed for people with
disabilities who are ambulatory.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:55.200
It features a self-closing door that swings
out and parallel grab bars that provide support

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.870
on both sides.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:03.340
Further guidance on accessible toilet rooms
and other requirements in the ADA and ABA

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.860
Standards is available from the U.S. Access
Board.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.420
This animation was developed by the U.S. Access
Board in cooperation with the federal agencies

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.730
that issue the ADA and ABA Standards.
