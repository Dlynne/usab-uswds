00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.740
The ADA and ABA Standards address access for
various types of disabilities and mobility

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.740
aids.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.350
Some provisions are best understood in relation
to the use of wheelchairs and powered devices.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.250
This animation illustrates wheelchair maneuvering
and requirements in the Standards for clearances,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.439
floor surfaces, and reach ranges.

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.550
Space at least 30 inches wide and 48 inches
long is required to accommodate an occupied

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.029
wheelchair.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.210
To allow room for movement and sway, accessible
routes must provide a continuous clear width

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.659
of at least 36 inches.

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:47.979
The width can reduce to 32 inches minimum
at points, such as doorways.

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.839
Segments with a reduced width are limited
to a depth of 24 inches, and there must be

00:00:52.839 --> 00:01:05.570
a separation of at least 48 inches between
them.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.659
Where routes make a turn around an obstruction,
additional space is required depending on

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.990
the tightness of the turn.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:23.540
If an obstruction is at least 48 inches wide,
additional clear width is not required.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.600
If an obstruction is less than 48 inches wide,
the route clear width can remain 36 inches

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:40.670
minimum if at least 60 inches is provided
at the turn to facilitate maneuvering.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:50.979
Otherwise, the clear width must be at least
42 inches approaching the turn, 48 inches

00:01:50.979 --> 00:02:04.590
minimum at the turn, and 42 inches beyond
the turn.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.979
Space at least 60 inches wide provides room
for wheelchairs to pass.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.879
Where routes are less than 60 inches wide,
passing space 60 inches by 60 inches minimum

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.970
is required at 200 foot intervals.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.950
Passing space can also be achieved at route
intersections with segments at least 48 inches

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.739
deep.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.080
Maneuvering clearances required at doors,
which are sized according to the approach

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.959
and swing, usually require additional space
beyond the minimum clear width of routes.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.970
Room for turning is required in certain spaces,
such as toilet rooms and dressing rooms.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.720
Turning space can be provided in the form
of a 60 inches minimum diameter circle or

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.319
a T-shaped space.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.769
Maneuvering for turns varies by mobility aid
and personal preferences and abilities.

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:08.659
With manual chairs, moving wheels in opposite
directions is the most efficient way to turn.

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.110
Turns can also be made by keeping one wheel
stationary.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.569
Among powered devices, the turning radius
can vary greatly.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.760
Objects that provide space for knees and toes
can overlap turning space.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.970
Minimizing such overlap or avoiding it altogether
is advisable to provide easier access, especially

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.650
for larger devices, such as scooters and power
chairs.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.500
Turning space can also be provided in the
shape of a "T" that is at least 60 inches

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.370
by 60 inches overall with segments at least
36 inches wide.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.379
This space can be oriented for approach on
any segment of the T. Objects with knee and

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:02.349
toe space can overlap only one segment of
the T so that the other two remain clear for

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.969
approach and backing up.

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:11.290
Turning within the minimum dimensions specified
can be difficult using scooters and similar

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.219
devices that have a larger turning radius.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:22.160
The availability of additional space beyond
the minimum required will ease maneuvering.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.260
Also, avoiding overlap of the space by an
object will better accommodate devices with

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.660
front tillers.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.100
The Standards also address ground and floor
surfaces.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:43.220
Surfaces must be firm, stable, and slip resistant,
and changes in level must be properly treated.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.940
Abrupt level changes can be difficult to negotiate
and catch front casters unless properly edged

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.830
or sloped.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.690
Changes in level up to one quarter inch are
permitted without treatment.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:06.220
Level changes up to half an inch must be beveled
with a slope no steeper than one to two.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:15.250
Changes in level higher than half an inch
must be ramped.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:22.350
The Standards also limit openings, such as
grates, in ground and floor surfaces.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.080
Surface openings that are too wide can catch
wheelchair front casters, as well as the tips

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.370
of crutches and walkers.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.800
Openings in accessible surfaces cannot exceed
half an inch in one dimension.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.490
Openings must be oriented so that the long
dimension is perpendicular to the direction

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.180
of travel.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.310
Carpet that is thick, soft, or loose can make
wheelchair maneuvering difficult.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.420
The Standards address pile height and texture
and require that carpet be firmly secured.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.990
Otherwise, rolling or buckling can occur,
greatly impairing wheelchair travel.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.720
Proper securement is needed to prevent carpet
from rolling or shifting.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.870
Wheelchair space is required at accessible
building elements.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:19.590
In general, this space can be oriented for
a forward or side approach, but a forward

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.930
approach is required at certain elements,
such as drinking fountains.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.580
This space must be at least 30 inches wide
and 48 inches long.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.930
If space for a forward approach is recessed
in an alcove or otherwise confined on both

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:43.320
sides more than 24 inches, the width is increased
to 36 inches.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.880
Clear floor space can be oriented for a side
approach at most elements.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.380
For side approaches, space that is recessed
or confined on both sides more than 15 inches

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:03.490
must be at least 60 inches deep to facilitate
maneuvering into the space.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.860
Space for knees and toes allows people using
wheelchairs to pull up sufficiently to elements

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:16.870
such as drinking fountains, lavatories and
sinks, and dining and work surfaces.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.270
Space for toes is 9 inches high and 6 inches
deep.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:29.660
The clearance must increase to 27 inches over
a span of 3 inches or a rate of six-to-one.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.710
The remainder of the space to the leading
edge must provide a clearance of at least

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.340
27 inches for knees.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:43.520
These clearances allow room for plumbing,
enclosures, and supports, which cannot protrude

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.430
into the knee and toe space.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:51.060
Where knee and toe space is required, it must
be at least 17 inches deep.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.860
The maximum total depth is 25 inches.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.540
Space beyond this depth is not usable.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:06.800
Accessible reach ranges extend from 48 inches
to 15 inches above the floor or ground.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.890
This applies to the operable parts of an element.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.170
Forward reaches do not extend far beyond the
toes.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:20.770
For this reason, the reach depth over an object
cannot exceed the available knee and toe space

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.770
below.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:28.490
If the reach depth is greater than 20 inches,
the maximum height is reduced from 48 inches

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.490
to 44 inches.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:36.719
The reach depth, like the knee and toe space,
is limited to 25 inches.

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:44.029
The side reach range is also 48 inches to
15 inches if unobstructed.

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:48.569
Obstructions are limited to a height of 34
inches.

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:53.329
The 48 inches maximum height is permitted
to a depth of 10 inches.

00:08:53.329 --> 00:09:01.339
The maximum height reduces to 46 inches beyond
a 10 inches depth up to the maximum depth

00:09:01.339 --> 00:09:03.860
of 24 inches.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:10.769
The reach to objects located in corners can
be difficult in view of the side reach radius.

00:09:10.769 --> 00:09:16.300
It is advisable, though not specifically required
in the Standards, to avoid locating objects

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:21.029
in corners accessed only from a side approach.

00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:28.850
Further guidance on the ADA and ABA Standards
is available from the U.S. Access Board.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:35.339
This animation was developed by the U.S. Access
Board in cooperation with the federal agencies

00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:38.889
that issue the ADA and ABA Standards.
