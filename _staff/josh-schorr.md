Josh Schorr serves as Accessibility Specialist in the Office of Technical and Information Services at the Access Board. Since 2010, Schorr’s focus at the Access Board has been developing training material to help the general public better understand accessibility requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Architectural Barriers Act (ABA). Schorr has developed multiple animations that explain built environment requirements by showing how a person with disabilities interacts with their environment. In addition to the animations, Schorr has created the images and layouts for the agency’s technical guides, which are developed for both print and online viewing, to synthesize concepts and clarify confusing issues for the purposes of better understandings of ADA and ABA requirements. In addition to developing the animations and guides, Schorr provides technical assistance to the general public via phone and email communication.
